Greinke, 39, had a 3.68 ERA in 137 innings back in Kansas City, and the Royals are interested in a return. The Braves made an opening offer in-season to star shortstop Dansby Swanson, and sources suggested it was in the $100 million ballpark. The friend thought Swanson, a Georgia product, preferred to stay in Atlanta. That\u2019s probably just a start, but it sounded like there\u2019s work to do.

Cashman\u2019s deal expires Dec. 31. The Angels\u2019 sale is serious and will happen. Word is, Arte Moreno should receive a record price, above Steve Cohen\u2019s $2.4 billion Mets purchase. Well-respected ex-Royals president Dayton Moore may go to work for the Rangers under Chris Young, who pitched in Kansas City for Moore. The White Sox\u2019s gamble on new manager Pedro Grifol is a good one. Extra credit here: White Sox take diversity seriously. Previous managers include Miguel Cairo, Rick Renteria and Ozzie Guillen. All signs point to former Milwaukee president of baseball operations David Stearns not receiving permission to interview elsewhere as he\u2019s under contract through 2023, which is the prerogative of Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, who tried locking up Stearns. The New York native will be somewhere else long term. Whether that\u2019s the Mets, which have twice pursued Stearns, or his former Astros, or someone else, is unknown. Houston already lost key execs Pete Putila (Giants) and Oz Ocampo (Marlins), and there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll bring back GM James Click despite his great record. Owner Jim Crane only told Houston media Click has done a \u201cgood job.\u201d But an Astros insider suggests a personality clash. Ranger Suarez was a great initial signing for $25K and Seranthony Dominguez for $60K by the Phillies. Ocampo was instrumental in signing Jose Urquidy, Cristian Javier, Framber Valdez and Luis Garcia for $140K total ($100K for Urquidy, $20K for Garcia and $10K for Javier and Valdez, via Fox).

They\u2019re rolling out the oldies. Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama are back on the campaign trail.

Bill Clinton didn\u2019t even try to disguise the ugly truth at a stop in Hurleyville, NY, for congressional hopeful Josh Riley. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. We do have too much inflation, and we do have too much crime,\u201d the ex-president conceded. \u201cBut all this tough talk doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans, that the Republicans are making,\u201d he continued in a syntactical tangle perhaps born of embarrassment. The trouble for Democrats is voters aren\u2019t thinking about beans, they\u2019re thinking about the Democratic Party\u2019s record in office as crime soars and prices at the supermarket shoot to the ceiling. Voters have little hope and want change. So what is ex-President Obama, the man whose brand was hope and change, up to now? He\u2019s courting TikTok influencers. Earlier this week he sat cross-legged on a beige-carpeted floor for an interview with a young man hiding under a desk. Nuclear fallout had not arrived in Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood \u2014 this weird scene was \u201cUnder the Desk News,\u201d and the fellow doing the duck-and-cover routine was its host, Vitus Spehar. Obama took to the show to urge its Gen Z audience to vote. But do the teens and twenty-somethings hooked on this Chinese-controlled short-form video app even remember the Obama years? TikTok is not exactly known for lengthening attention spans. Gov. Hochul, fearful of the strides Republican Lee Zeldin has made in recent polls, has also turned to the Democrats\u2019 retirement bench for help. Hillary Clinton warmed up the crowd for Hochul at a Manhattan rally on Thursday. But the biggest draw of the night was neither the ex-senator nor the sitting governor, but a woman who took the stage to the easy-listening vibe of Bill Withers\u2019 \u201cLovely Day.\u201d That laid-back standard was the intro music for Vice President Kamala Harris, who proceeded to show just how limited the Democrats\u2019 message is today. Harris, like Hochul, placed great emphasis on the Dobbs decision that returned abortion law to the states. Hochul had claimed that abortion only remained legal in New York because she remained governor \u2014 a message that Harris actually undercut by reminding the crowd that law is actually made in state houses, not by governors. Though she outshines Hochul, the vice president has none of the star power of the ex-presidents who are out on the stump. Her office rather than her charisma is the draw. Her remarks, delivered in familiar nasal register, mostly touted the national achievements of the Biden administration, with a few mentions of New York issues such as \u201c$100 million for electric MTA buses.\u201d Hochul joined hands with Harris and ex-Sen. Clinton at the end of the rally, an image evidently meant to inspire the women in attendance. But Clinton was the woman who cost the Democrats the White House in 2016, and Harris is part of the administration that will soon cost Democrats control of Congress \u2014 ominous company for an unelected governor. Hochul hopes she\u2019ll keep her head above the wave next week. But her party is already sunk, thanks to its retreat from the relatively tough-on-crime policies of the Clinton days and the hopeful message of Obama. The Democrats today are a party of fear, even though what voters fear most is not Dobbs or Donald Trump, but more of the crime and misery that Democrats have been giving them.

We haven\u2019t done a \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 movie in 15 years. The DC movies and the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 movies provided a lot of the profits of Warner Bros.

Rowling has since been accused of transphobia. \u201cIf sex isn\u2019t real, there\u2019s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn\u2019t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased,\u201d the author tweeted in June 2020. \u201cI know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I,\u201d Daniel Radcliffe wrote in an essay at the time.

Rick Bowmer/AP hide caption Gabby Petito's mother Nichole Schmidt, wipes a tear from her face during a news conference Thursday, Nov. 3, 2022, in Salt Lake City. Gabby Petito's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit alleging that police failed to recognize their daughter was in a life-threatening situation last year when officers investigated a fight between her and her boyfriend. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Family members of a 22-year-old woman whose boyfriend admitted to killing her last year have filed a wrongful death suit against the Moab Police Department, claiming their negligence led to her death weeks later. The lawsuit filed on Thursday is the latest development in the high-profile case around Gabby Petito's death. What began as a missing person's case last summer rode a wave of true crime obsession to become a social media sensation, drawing amateur online sleuths and the kind of worldwide attention that can help authorities locate missing people. Petito and her boyfriend, 23-year-old Brian Laundrie, were stopped by police officers in Moab, Utah last summer but were ultimately not cited for domestic violence amid signs of distress and their own statements about physical conflict. Petito's body was later found on the edge of Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming after being strangled. Laundrie was the only person ever identified by law enforcement as a person of interest and was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after returning alone to his parents' home in Florida. The contrast between the cheerful fa\u00e7ade on display on Petito's widely followed Instagram account \u2014 where she chronicled her cross-country trip in a van to tens of thousands of followers \u2014 and the darker reality of domestic violence she was experiencing in the lead-up to her death captivated millions and sparked unprecedented national conversation about dating violence. It also brought criticism of authorities and the news media for focusing more attention on missing white women like Petito than on missing and murdered indigenous women and women of color. Petito's mother, father and other family members have sought to keep her name in the news, hoping to honor her legacy and help make sure signs of abuse are recognized by authorities in a position to intervene, they said. \"There are laws put in place to protect victims. And those laws were not followed. And we don't want this to happen to anybody else,\" said Nicole Schmidt, Petito's mother, her voice quivering. Schmidt, other family members and their team of lawyers stood in front of a picture of Petito smiling in a slot canyon at a Thursday press conference in Salt Lake City. The wrongful death lawsuit seeks $50 million in damages from the police department in Moab, a rural Utah city known for being an entryway to national parks full of red rock canyons and mesas. It lays blame for Petito's death on the city's police officers, who did not issue a domestic violence citation after a bystander called to report conflict between Petito and Laundrie. In doing so, the lawsuit claims officers disregarded signs of violence they should have been trained to notice. In this image taken from police body camera video provided by The Moab Police Department, Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Petito talks to a police officer after police pulled over the van she was traveling in with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, near the entrance to Arches National Park on Aug. 12, 2021. AP hide caption The suit also claims police officers \"coached Gabby to provide answers that the officers used to justify their decision not to enforce Utah law,\" which requires action be taken in response to domestic violence incidents. Moab Police Officer Eric Pratt \"was fundamentally biased in his approach to the investigation, choosing to believe Gabby's abuser, ignoring evidence that Gabby was the victim and intentionally looking for loopholes to get around the requirements of Utah law and his duty to protect Gabby.\" The complaint bases that bias claim off of an unnamed woman referred to as \"Witness 1,\" who alleges Pratt threatened to kill her after their relationship ended while he was serving as police chief in Salina, Utah, another rural town. After the lawsuit was filed, the city of Moab said the death was tragic yet not the fault of their police department. Pratt did not respond to a phone call requesting comment and the city of Moab said no employee of the city or police department would be commenting further at this time. \"Our officers acted with kindness, respect, and empathy toward Ms. Petito,\" city spokesperson Lisa Adams said in a statement. \"No one could have predicted the tragedy that would occur weeks later and hundreds of miles away, and the City of Moab will ardently defend against this lawsuit.\" The lawsuit follows a notice of claim filed in August, notifying Moab that Petito's family intended to file for damages due to wrongful death.

The startling new text messages released by the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office give a glimpse into the alleged physical and verbal abuse Christian Obumseli endured during his tempestuous relationship with Clenney. \u201cFebruary was the worst month I had so far,\u201d the 27-year-old cryptocurrency trader wrote to the social media darling just weeks before his April death. \u201cI got cheated on. I got called that word again. I got slapped in my stitches that has re-opened multiple times and it\u2019s not healing fast enough.\u201d Clenney, who boasts 2 million Instagram followers and had a once-thriving OnlyFans account under the name Courtney Tailor, is facing second-degree murder raps for allegedly plunging a knife Obumseli\u2019s chest during an argument at their Miami apartment. Prosecutors have painted her as the manipulative aggressor in their troubled relationship \u2014 and have slowly publicly released damning pieces of evidence to bolster their claims. In an October 2021 text \u2014 reported by the Miami Herald on Thursday \u2014 Obumseli indicated that he had brushed off Clenney stabbing him in the leg. \u201cI still gave you a good day even though my leg was hurting because my girlfriend stabbed me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDid I make you feel like s\u2013t for stabbing me? No just sucked it up and hoped tomorrow will be better.\u201d The texts depict Clenney treating Obumseli as a meek submissive \u2014 telling him at one point that she was tired having to \u201cexplain to you how to act.\u201d Another exchange indicates that Obumseli required medical treatment after Clenney gashed him during a fight. \u201cEnjoy the hospital,\u201d she told him after the incident. From his hospital bed, Obumseli texted Clenney repeatedly, asking why she was ignoring him while he recovered from the wounds she inflicted. She apologized to him days after the incident. \u201cI love you so much Christian. I should have been at the hospital with you and i should have slept next to you i always have,\u201d she wrote. Elsewhere, Obumseli muses about ruining her career by revealing her behavior. \u201cLike honestly think to yourself I\u2019ve cut this person\u2019s face I have stabbed him I have called him out of his name to the highest level,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd he could if he was an evil person he can ruin my career he can go to the police go to the courtroom.\u201d In August, prosecutors released disturbing video showing Clenney fighting with her boyfriend in an elevator just two months before his death. Clenney claims that she killed Obumseli in self-defense, casting him as an unpredictable stalker. Her lawyer, Frank Prieto, said the texts did not reflect the totality of their toxic relationship. The attorney also suggested that he has evidence corroborating Clenney\u2019s version of events that will emerge in court. \u201cThe evidence provided to the media as part of public discovery by the State Attorney\u2019s Office is a one sided snapshot in time,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not the whole story.

Old phones sitting in a drawer can start a fire YouTuber Arun Maini, who runs a popular channel called Mrwhosetheboss, has collected every Samsung flagship phone since 2010. He noticed a scary pattern. The phone\u2019s batteries are swelling enough to crack the glass and split the cases. It\u2019s not just Samsung phones . Any gadget with a lithium-ion battery is susceptible to damage over time. A swollen battery is a serious issue that can lead to fires, injuries, and property damage. Rummage through your drawers for your old phones, and look for any signs of battery swelling. If you see it, here\u2019s what to do: Don\u2019t try to charge a swollen phone. Charging a swollen battery can trigger a fire or explosion. If you have an older phone with an easily removable battery, carefully separate the battery from the case. If you have a newer phone, don\u2019t attempt to remove the battery yourself. Put the swollen phone in a fireproof bag and contact the manufacturer. You may not be able to exchange an old model or get anything for it. However, at the very least, arrange for it to be recycled or disposed of properly. When it comes to storing old phones, follow these rules of thumb: Turn off the phone and put it in a cool, moisture-free place. Charge the battery to 50% if you plan on storing it for a long time. Check the battery every six months or so and charge it halfway. A guest holds the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 7, 2022.

Hochul is trying to avoid offending voters before Election Day by delaying action on a backlog of more than 420 bills that passed the legislature.", "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul is ducking any chance she\u2019ll offend voters and powerful interest groups before Election Day by delaying action on a backlog of more than 420 bills that passed the legislature earlier this year, The Post has learned. The hand-sitting on either signing or vetoing the state action, critics say, comes as Hochul fights for her political life in a neck-and-neck race against Republican rival Lee Zeldin heading into Tuesday\u2019s election. Some of the measures target the medical, bank, real estate and cryptocurrency mining industries that are hefty Hochul campaign donors, while others would benefit donor-friendly trial lawyers and transit worker unions, a list review by The Post reveals. \u201cThe governor has made a strategic decision not to sign or call up lots and lots of bills until after the election. It\u2019s enormously frustrating,\u201d said John Kaehny, director of the government watchdog group Reinvent Albany. The stall has drawn frustration from even key Democratic allies. For example, 56 members of the Black, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus sent a secret letter to Hochul \u2014 a copy of which was leaked to The Post \u2014 urging the governor to sign the Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act into law. The bill passed the state Assembly and Senate on May 3. \u201cThe prompt signing of FAPA into law is of particular concern to our Caucus since manipulative foreclosure practices disproportionately harm communities of color,\u201d reads the letter, signed by Assemblywoman Michelle Solages (D-Valley Stream), the caucus chairwoman, and 55 other minority lawmakers. \u201cWith each passing day, New York homeowners are increasingly losing their homes to what would otherwise be time-barred foreclosure actions. The FAPA should be signed into law in its current form without further delay.\u201d The measure, cosponsored by state Sen. James Sanders (D-Queens) and Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein (D-Brooklyn), seeks to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling that reopened hundreds of foreclosure cases that homeowners thought they had won because lenders missed a key deadline. \u201cSince May, there have been no justifications as to why mortgage lenders should be afforded a privilege \u2014 the unilateral ability to manipulate and thus evade the statute of limitations which no other litigant enjoys in New York,\u201d the lawmakers told Hochul. But big real estate and banking industry players, including Hochul donors, lobbied against the bill \u2014 among them, J.P. Morgan Chase, Capital One and KeyBanc. The City first reported on the fight over the bill after it passed the legislature in May. A ban on cryptocurrency mining at old fossil fuel plants has also been left in the lurch. Mayor Eric Adams , a booster of the crypto industry and also a backer of the fellow-Democrat governor, has urged Hochul to veto the bill. Hochul has reported a $40,000 campaign donation from Ashton Aoniat, Chairman & CEO of Coinmint, which operates one of the world\u2019s largest crypto mining facilities in upstate Massena as well as lobbyists tied to the industry. Another measure outlaws sales of dogs, cats and rabbits in retail pet stores. The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) and Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal (D-Manhattan) is strongly supported by animal rights activists to crack down on abusive \u201cpuppy mills\u201d who supply the pets to retail stores. But it is opposed by shop owners, who claim their stores will be put out of business. \u201cNew York is complicit in animal abuse and it has to stop,\u201d said Libby Post, head of the New York Animal Protection Federation. Noting the overwhelming support for the bill in the legislature, Post said, \u201cProtecting puppies and kittens is the last bastion of bipartisanship and non-partisanship.\u201d Another widely popular piece of legislation would restore the state comptroller\u2019s authority to pre-audit contracts and sign off on spending, which was removed by ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his first term in 2011. The removal of state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli\u2019s oversight preceded the Buffalo Billion bid-rigging scandal that led to corruption convictions of key Cuomo associates, including top aide Joe Percoco and Alain Kaloyeros. Stricter oversight of executive spending would also prevent the type of play to play accusations that have haunted Hochul, including a brewing scandal involving a $637 million, no-bid contract for COVID rapid tests her administration gave to a company linked to $300,000 in contributions to her campaign.

There are ongoing negotiations over the auditing bill, which emerged as an issue in the only televised debate between Hochul and Republican gubernatorial rival Lee Zeldin, Kaehny said. Hochul typically negotiates to amend bills rather than veto them, added Kaehny. Another bill would make it harder for hospitals and doctors \u2014 major Hochul donors \u2014 to collect debt from patients. The Post reported in September that Hochul attended a secret meeting at the Upper East Side townhouse of Alexander Rovt \u2014 a billionaire mega-donor to her campaign whose hospital network was bailed out by the state in April. The consumer measure, pushed by Assemblyman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) and Sen. Gustavo Rivera (D-Bronx) protects patients from liens against their primary residence and wage garnishment due to money judgments owed to hospitals or doctors. Elsewhere, one bill pits the trial lawyers against the business community. The Grieving Families Act bill would allow New York courts to take emotional loss into consideration in a wrongful death case. The trial lawyers, who are big Hochul and Democratic Party donors, support the measure \u2014 while dozens of business groups oppose it, claiming there\u2019d be a big spike in medical malpractice premiums. Other measures would require at least two workers on rail passenger trains and bar discrimination against asylum seekers and green-card holders. Team Hochul disputed the assertion that she is stalling on the legislation. \u201cSince taking office, Gov. Hochul has signed nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation, including almost 600 so far this year, that \u2014 whether the Post reports it or not \u2014 are strengthening public safety, keeping New Yorkers safe from gun violence, ensuring quality education for every child, delivering tax relief to hardworking New Yorkers, and supporting small businesses, and we are reviewing the remaining legislation,\u201d said Hochul spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays. Hochul signed 581 out of 1,007 bills \u2014 or 57% \u2014 of the bills that passed the legislature into law this year, more than in prior years, the governor\u2019s office said.", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [14.526976585388184, 13.731953620910645]}, {"title": "Kathy Hochul\u2019s aides shield her from questions about Keaira Bennefield\u2019s murder", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/aides-shield-kathy-hochul-from-keaira-bennefield-murder-questions/", "description": "Gov.

Kathy Hochul hid behind her handlers and bodyguards Thursday to avoid addressing her claim that \u201cthe system\u201d was to blame for the shocking, bail reform-related killing of an upstate mother of three. During a campaign event at an MTA bus depot on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, Hochul \u2014 who sits atop the state\u2019s government \u2014 ignored repeated questions from The Post while being shielded by her political aides and members of her security detail. At one point, the Democratic incumbent even locked eyes with a reporter before looking away. Two campaign aides also ran interference for Hochul, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s not taking questions\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re not doing any questions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re sticking with the schedule, trying to keep everything organized here,\u201d one said during the 20-minute event. On Monday, the mother of tragic Buffalo mom Keaira Bennefield said Hochul \u201c should be charged \u201d in the Oct. 5 shotgun slaying of Bennefield, who was allegedly shot by her estranged husband one day after he was freed without bail in an earlier, alleged assault on her. \u201cShe failed me,\u201d grieving mom Tammy Hudson said of the governor. \u201cShe let me down and my daughter down, and she needs to make a change with the bail reform.\u201d In response, Hochul deflected blame on Wednesday, saying that \u201cthe system absolutely failed\u201d Keaira Bennefield. \u201cThe system has to work,\u201d Hochul said at the time. \u201cOrders of protection have to be granted, transition homes have to be available and we have to make sure that judges and prosecutors charge appropriately.\u201d Hochul has ignored widespread calls to roll back the state\u2019s controversial, 2019 bail reform law, including from Mayor Eric Adams, who was rebuffed when he asked her to call a special session of the Legislature earlier this year. Instead, Hochul said there wouldn\u2019t be any serious discussion of the issue until after the Legislature reconvenes in January. By contrast, her challenger \u2014 outgoing Rep.

In fact, my daughters bought me one of those DNA ancestry spit kits and it revealed that I\u2019m 99 percent European Ashkenazi Jew and 1 percent Bonomo Turkish Taffy. Jews, as flat-earth theorist Kyrie Irving recently shared on antisocial media , are slave-traders controlled by Satan. Yep, the Mushnicks and the Satan Families have been tight for generations. Sunday nights, we\u2019d have Chinese food with the Satans. For some reason, they preferred Szechuan. Can\u2019t recall my folks or grandparents swapping slaves with the Satans; it seems I\u2019d rememberer that. While Irving\u2019s sense of applied and shared history seems to be in accord with the 12th Century Inquisition and genocidal Nazis of the 20th Century, I wonder if he knows of three more recent historical figures: James Chaney, a black man from Mississippi, and Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, two young Jews from New York City. I highly doubt Irving, despite his Duke University pedigree, has heard of them and I highly doubt that what now passes for black leadership \u2014 the selectively silent from Jesse Jackson to Al Sharpton to Louis Farrakhan to LeBron James to Kanye West \u2014 would encourage young African-Americans to learn of them. Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman were civil rights workers on a mission in Mississippi in 1964. They were murdered by Ku Klux Klan members. Chaney was 21, Schwerner was 24 and Goodman was 20. Starting with the formation of the NAACP in 1909 in NYC, there have been a preponderance of Jews in black civil rights movements. They shared the commonality and brutality of illogical, ignorant Kyrie Irving-like bigotry. But now we see, hear and read of \u201cenlightened\u201d black men and women turning Jews such as Goodman and Schwerner from martyrs to suckers. It\u2019s a colossal betrayal generated and spread by practiced hate and race hustlers who now win attention and even support on demand. Still, I suppose, Ian Eagle, the Jewish TV play-by-play man for the Nets on YES, will have to sound pleased and excited when Irving hits a jumper \u2014 in those games Irving decides to play. The Nets acquired Irving and paid him tens of millions of dollars despite two previous NBA stops during which he provided ample evidence that he\u2019s fools\u2019 gold, far more trouble than he\u2019s worth. In the meantime \u2026 The Nets took a wait-and-see approach to Irving\u2019s insidiously stupid bigotry , as if there were something to weigh, a reasonable debate to be heard on whether Jews take orders from Satan. Said Nets general manager Sean Marks: \u201cThere\u2019s an education piece for everyone here.\u201d There is? What do I need to learn from this that I didn\u2019t know? Or should we just agree to disagree and get ready to host the Mavericks? The Nets regularly enrich disgusting players, have become a disgusting franchise in a disgusting league and are expected to hire a disgusting coach . The double standards that those in sports now hope we don\u2019t notice as they point us all backwards are glaring. How long would NBA commissioner Adam Silver wait to act if a white player publicly attacked blacks as literal devils? That player would be gone \u2014 good riddance \u2014 and nationally vilified before you could say John Bleepin\u2019 Rocker. It took until Thursday for Silver to express he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Irving,\u201d prior to the Nets suspending him for at least five game, and to say in a statement that he plans to soon meet with \u201cKyrie.\u201d \u201cDisappointed\u201d as opposed to incensed or livid? Meanwhile, more than a few black leaders continue to encourage resentment of Jews. Why? Is it resentment of achievement, strong family structures, emphasis on education, health, prosperity and charity? The ability to survive pogroms and then thrive again? But I\u2019m arguing common sense, something that has so clearly escaped Irving and others without the ability or willingness to know and say better. Irving only understands the visceral, something he saw in a movie, a black-version remake of Joseph Goebbels\u2019 \u201cEternal Jew.\u201d So go to hell, Kyrie. I\u2019ll see you there. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred claims that most everyone he speaks with loves the automatic second-base runner come the 10th inning. That\u2019s proof that he\u2019s either full of it or doesn\u2019t consort with baseball fans. I\u2019ve received hundreds of emails on the subject. Only one \u2014 just one \u2014 claimed to like it. Most recognized that it\u2019s another capitulation to diminished skills and misapplied analytics. Phillies manager Rob Thomson: \u201cDuring the playoffs, I don\u2019t [like it]. I think you play baseball.\u201d And that\u2019s how it remains \u2014 for now. But, Thomson added: \u201cWhen you get into one of those 17-, 18-inning games, you\u2019re going through pretty much everybody out of your bullpen, and then you\u2019ve got to start making player moves. And when guys have to be down 15 days and you just sent down three or four of your pitchers, you can\u2019t bring them back. \u2026 You don\u2019t want that.\u201d Understood. But why must managers use everyone in their bullpens? If effective relievers are allowed to continue pitching, as a matter of in-game logic rather \u201cassigned innings,\u201d games make more sense and are played faster. Why should rules be different based on whether it\u2019s the playoffs? As Thomson said, \u201cYou play baseball.\u201d Keepin\u2019 it real: That eight Michigan State players have been suspended for a vicious attack on Michigan players after their loss at Michigan , is what\u2019s commonly known as a \u201cgang assault,\u201da reflection on the recruitment of \u201cstudent-athletes.\u201d Of course, not that infuriated Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was going to bring it up, but Wolverines recruits have a nasty habit for being arrested for various crimes. Perhaps that gives new meaning to Michigan\u2019s stadium as \u201cThe Big House.\u201d Gee, those street-cred black helmets the Jets wore at home against the Patriots on Sunday were a real game-changer! You think Panthers wide receiver D.J. Moore has stopped smiling and high-fiving teammates long enough to realize that his photo-op TD \u201ccelebration\u201d at the end of regulation against the Falcons on Sunday cost his team the game? Five years in the NFL and he doesn\u2019t know the rules? Next! Fox\u2019s Mark Sanchez, with the Giants third-and-4 from their own 34 in Seattle: \u201cHuge third-down for the Giants.\u201d Really?

Mike Breen was given the Vin Scully Award for sportscasting excellence by WFUV, Fordham\u2019s radio station that so well served them and then us.

At the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, 242 W 45th Street. Under the bright lights of 45th Street, though, the greatest foe of the musical \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d is most definitely the film \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d Cameron Crowe\u2019s 2000 comedy is a quirky, coming-of-age cinematic gem, which won him an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and our fond memories of it \u2014 a manic-pixie-dream-girl Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand announcing \u201cMy son has been kidnapped by rockstars!\u201d \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d on the tour bus \u2014 are a persistent thorn in the stage version\u2019s side. Those classic bits are all still here, yes, but they\u2019re a wisp of the original. British director Jeremy Herrin, who should stick to plays and steer clear of Stratocasters, composer-lyricist Tom Kitt and book writer-lyricist Crowe do not present a compelling case for why the film must be a Broadway musical. It\u2019s pleasant and sweet and passes the time, sure, but should that be enough? Near the end of the show, Sapphire, a member of an elite clique of groupies called the Band Aids, observes that 20 years on, they\u2019ll all remember their time with groovy leader Penny Lane. Perhaps. But the audience completely forgets about \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d the musical by 43rd Street. Semi-autobiographical, Crowe\u2019s stand-in is William Miller (Casey Likes), a meek 15-year-old in 1973 San Diego with a domineering mom and a rebellious sister who encourages his love of rock groups, like The Who. He starts to dabble in music journalism, and gets a chance to interview Black Sabbath for his mentor Lester Bangs\u2019 (Rob Colletti, a funny crank) Creem magazine. It\u2019s on that fateful assignment when he meets Stillwater, a middle-of-the-road band that William obsesses over. Even though the guys sneer that the kid is the enemy, he weasels his way backstage by flattering them \u2014 and they welcome them into their ragtag family. That\u2019s dangerous. In the back of William\u2019s mind is hardened Bangs\u2019 No. 1 piece of advice: \u201cDon\u2019t make friends with the rockstars.\u201d Wide-eyed Willy does anyway. And soon he\u2019s assigned by Rolling Stone, who assumes he\u2019s much older, to follow Stillwater on tour for a 3,000 word story. Can he deliver something deeper than a puff piece? He also gets his first taste of love in the form of Penny Lane (Solea Pfeiffer), a free spirit who is also sort of dating Russell Hammond (Chris Wood), Stillwater\u2019s evasive guitarist. The plot, exactly the same as the film\u2019s, is not the problem. Coming of age works well in musicals. The No. 1 issue, as it so often is, is Broadway vs. Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. Real rock songs from the film\u2019s soundtrack such as Elton John\u2019s \u201cTiny Dancer,\u201d Cat Stevens\u2019 \u201cThe Wind\u201d and Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSimple Man\u201d are back. Paired with Tom Kitt\u2019s sappy score, which is one Smooth FM number after another, they stick out like an oboe in Metallica. Kitt has decided on a musical theater soundscape for when characters are offstage to contrast the headbanging. That makes sense. But tunes like \u201cLost in New York City\u201d and \u201cListen to Me\u201d have even less edge than his faux-rock music for \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d which was set entirely in an upper middle-class suburban home. And the lyrics by Crowe and Kitt are dismal. When Russell and Penny duet on \u201cThe Night-Time Sky\u2019s Got Nothing on You,\u201d the married rocker praises, \u201cThe way you turn a hotel room into a home.\u201d What is this? A musical or a Marriott ad? Penny, played capably but not magically by Solea Pfeiffer, also has a clunkier song about her dream of moving to Morocco. \u201cDo you long for better than this, a way to escape the abyss? Morocco!\u201d it goes and goes some more. As William\u2019s mother, Elaine, Anika Larsen is eerily like Frances McDormand in voice and mannerism. The actress is maternal and does nothing wrong, but she lacks McDormand\u2019s electric unpredictability. And the members of Stillwater \u2014 Wood as Hammond and Drew Gehling as Bebe are most visible, just as the singer and guitarist would be in reality \u2014 amp their gags up the right amount. Most of the jokes are theirs, yet they shrewdly avoid going full Spinal Tap. It\u2019s not the fault of Wood and Pfeiffer that their characters\u2019 not-so-secret romance drags down the show and feels B-side the point. They all inhabit Derek McLane\u2019s overly straightforward set, which falls far short of more exciting behind-the-music designs like \u201cTina: The Tina Turner Musical\u201d or even the final heart-pumping arena scene of \u201cMJ.\u201d Like the scenery, the lights by Natasha Katz are too Broadway and not enough rock concert. Keeping \u201cFamous\u201d from face-planting is its best find, newcomer Likes. Of course, the 20-year-old actor is helped along by a naturally endearing role, but he plays the part more eagerly than Patrick Fugit did in the film and he has a wonderful voice. He often chooses softness over loud pop stridency, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a Broadway performer in an assembly-line musical have the confidence to hold back. His number \u201cNo Friends,\u201d in which his lonely character wrestles with a desire to be a good journalist and his deeper craving for companionship, is the show\u2019s only good new song. If there is one thing that makes \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d come alive, it\u2019s watching two coming-of-age stories play out at once: One, about a young journalist figuring out his future. The other, about an exciting new Broadway actor stepping out onto the boards.", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "nypost", "category": "entertainment", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-3.1087799072265625, -5.154003143310547]}, {"title": "Tua Tagovailoa 'not afraid' of Super Bowl talk after NFL trade deadline: 'Full belief that we are capable'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tua-tagovailoa-not-afraid-super-bowl-talk-after-nfl-trade-deadline-full-belief-we-are-capable", "description": "Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa always believed in his team, but Tuesday's NFL trade deadline deals solidified Miami as a Super Bowl contender.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for November 3 Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

The owner of an exclusive beachfront California restaurant and his 13-year-old son were killed in a fiery crash Tuesday night after a suspected drunken driver slammed his sedan into their classic Mustang, igniting an explosion. Police have not officially released the victims\u2019 identities, pending an investigation from the coroner\u2019s office, but friends revealed on social media that Andrea Bullo, 60, and his 13-year-old son Marco, were the crash victims.

His car was also totaled, but he appeared to have escaped largely unscathed in video taken at the scene shortly after the crash. Bullo owned the trendy Moonshadows Malibu restaurant, a celebrity hot spot right on the Malibu beach, which he opened with two friends in 2001.

The FBI's Newark office released a statement urging synagogues to \"take all security precautions to protect your community and facility.\" The alert was posted after officials discovered an online threat directed broadly at synagogues in New Jersey, a law enforcement official said.

In Jersey City, Mayor Steven Fulop said police would be posted at the city's seven synagogues and foot patrols would be added in the broader Jewish community.

The no-contest plea means Bridges, who was present in court, is accepting the punishment and the conviction without formally admitting guilt in the case. Bridges was accused of assaulting his then-girlfriend in front of their two children in May. In July, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon's office filed three felony charges against Bridges, who initially pleaded not guilty to all three. On Thursday, Bridges' attorney and the DA's office reached an agreement that he plead no contest to one felony count of injuring a child's parent and that the other two counts be dismissed. The felony charges also included \"an allegation of causing great bodily injury on the domestic violence victim,\" and that allegation was dismissed as part of the plea agreement. The two dismissed counts were charges of child abuse under circumstances or conditions likely to cause great bodily injury or death. The DA's July release said the children were present for the alleged assault but did not otherwise specify what the child abuse counts stemmed from. During his three-year probation, Bridges, 24, will be required to complete 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling and 52 weeks of parenting classes, serve 100 hours of community service and undergo weekly narcotics testing with marijuana allowed only if there is a valid doctor's prescription. He cannot own any guns or ammunition or any dangerous weapons. He also will have to pay a restitution fine of $300 (with a restitution hearing scheduled for Jan. 13) and a domestic violence fine of $500, and obey the terms of a 10-year protective order, staying 100 yards away from and having no contact with the woman. Bridges and the woman maintain custody over their two children, and any visitation or exchange of children must be done peacefully and through a neutral third party. \"We believe this resolution was the best avenue to hold Mr. Bridges accountable for his conduct,\" the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. \"We also understand through the victim's representatives that the victim wanted an expedited resolution of the case. The victim and her representatives were consulted about the proposed resolution and agreed with the outcome of the case.\" Bridges' attorney declined comment. At the moment, Bridges remains unsigned, but if he were to sign with a team, the NBA, under the collective bargaining agreement, has the right to suspend, fine, dismiss or disqualify him from any further association from the league because he pleaded no contest. Bridges was arrested June 29 by Los Angeles police and released on $130,000 bond. The Hornets and NBA both said they were aware of the charges, with the league noting it is investigating the allegations. Before his arrest, the Hornets had extended the 6-foot-7 Bridges a qualifying offer, which allows them a chance to match any offer sheet he signs with another team.

Michael Dwyer/AP hide caption The Starbucks logo is seen on a storefront in Boston on Oct. 14, 2022. Starbucks drinks are the most expensive they've ever been , but customers keep coming back. As stores nationwide hiked prices due to inflation, sales continued to climb, the company said in its earnings report released on Thursday. The global coffee chain reported record-breaking sales over the last fiscal quarter that ended in October. In North America, sales were up 11% compared to the same period last year. Starbucks saw a 10% increase in the average ticket, meaning customers spent 10% more on each purchase this year than they did during the same period last year, on average, according to the report. In North America, Starbucks generated $6.1 billion in revenue last quarter, up 15% from the prior year \u2014 another all-time record, said Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and CFO, on a conference call with investors. But profits were down, at $1.1 billion last quarter compared to $1.3 billion the prior year. As its competitors also feel the heat of inflation, Starbucks has more room to hike up its own prices, said David Reibstein, a marketing consultant and professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. \"As they raise the price, they've got so much customer loyalty that they're still able to keep those particular customers,\" he said. Still, the company faces challenges elsewhere as it continues to push back against national unionization. Earlier this week, federal labor officials ordered Starbucks to re-open a popular location in Ithaca, New York, that the company shut down earlier this year. Workers at the Ithaca location near Cornell University, who voted 19-1 to unionize, allege that Starbucks closed the location due to union activity. Workers United, affiliated with the massive Service Employees International Union, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday. As NPR previously reported , more than 300 stores have had union elections and about 250 Starbucks stores have successfully unionized over the past year. A store in Buffalo, New York was the first to form a union last December. But unionized stores in the United States make up about 3% of about 9,000 company-owned locations across the country. Plus, any negative PR from the unionization activity doesn't seem to have a huge impact on sales, according to Reibstein. \"The unionization is almost a separate issue,\" he said, explaining that not very many customers are concerned about the labor and union issues. Starbucks founder and interim CEO Howard Schultz said the company plans to add eight new stores per day to reach a goal of 45,000 locations globally in 2025. \"We continue to manage the business through today's challenging operating environment,\" Schultz told investors on the conference call. And don't expect prices to come down anytime soon. \"Right now, we're at a stage where everybody is expecting inflation and not overly put out by the fact that Starbucks is doing it,\" said Reibstein.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "business", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [19.041658401489258, -3.1643548011779785]}, {"title": "Parents of Texas school shooting survivor want \u2018coward\u2019 cops to hear her heartbreaking 911 call", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/uvalde-survivors-dad-wants-coward-cops-to-hear-911-call/", "description": "Miah, who turns 12 on Friday, first begged for help 30 minutes before the officers she could hear in the hallway finally stormed the classroom and ended 19-year-old sicko Salvador Ramos' carnage.", "content": "A young Uvalde school shooting survivor begged 911 for help even as shots rang out around her \u2014 a heartbreaking call her parents now want to be heard by every \u201ccoward\u201d Texas cop who failed to help her.

Sadly, Neil passed away unexpectedly in February 2020 after suffering stomach issues. Kennedy was determined to meet her biological father, whose name Neil couldn\u2019t remember. She was ecstatic when she received a DNA match in September 2020 for a half sister, Kayla, 30, from New Orleans; and an aunt, Kathy, 66, who lived in Highlands, Texas. \u201cI cried because I\u2019ve always looked for a mother and a father \u2014 I never thought I would have siblings,\u201d she gushed. The sisters downloaded their \u201craw DNA\u201d and uploaded it onto another website called GEDmatch, which revealed they share a father. The pair reached out to their aunt, who helped connect them with their birth father \u2014 even sending them a photo. \u201cWhen I saw the photo, my heart dropped to my toes,\u201d Kennedy recalled. \u201cI knew it was him, he looked like Kayla.\u201d They began writing letters to each other, with Cavalier; his wife, Ragnhildur; and their seven-year-old son, Ajay, living on Roat\u00e1n, an island off the coast of Honduras. \u201cHe completely accepted us both. He was so open and sweet and wanted to get to know us,\u201d Kennedy said. She made plans to travel to meet him in September 2021, but was waylaid due to COVID-19 concerns. She settled on November 2021 instead, but postponed when her father was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. Tragically, he died in February 2022 at the age of 62 before they could meet in person. His death came two weeks after Kennedy was scheduled to travel to Honduras, but had to cancel because she contracted the coronavirus. \u201cThat was terrible. It was so hard. I hated we got COVID the week we were meant to go,\u201d she said, adding that she has been seeing a therapist over her loss. Kennedy made it to her father\u2019s home in March 2022, helping his family spread his ashes. \u201cWe all spread his ashes in the Caribbean Sea, and it was the only time I got to touch and hold him,\u201d she said, adding that although the journey has been difficult, she is thankful it\u2019s brought her closer to her biological family. \u201cI feel like a transformed person from the woman I was in 2019. I have found all of my people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look at your biological parents and see your features in them, it is the purest self you have ever known.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-5.112358093261719, 4.9516921043396]}, {"title": "How Taylor Swift\u2019s 2023 Eras tour is ruining weddings across the US", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/how-taylor-swifts-2023-eras-tour-is-ruining-weddings/", "description": "It's a love story baby just say \u2014 reschedule?", "content": "It\u2019s a love story baby just say \u2014 reschedule?

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. New Jersey\u2019s status as a reliable Democratic state got cemented during former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The party picked up four U.S. House seats in 2018, though one of them flipped to the GOP when Jeff Van Drew switched parties because of his opposition to the first Trump impeachment. Going into this month's election, Democrats control 10 of the state\u2019s dozen seats, while the GOP has two. The 7th District sequel between Malinowski and Kean is perhaps the most closely watched contest. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night : Election Night Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. GOP WINS \u2018BALLOT BOX TRANSPARENCY\u2019 LAWSUIT IN GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN How New Jersey Votes New Jersey has a mix of early mail and in-person voting, along with Election Day voting at polling places. Voters can get a mail-in ballot without an excuse and can vote by dropping ballots in drop boxes, the mailbox or taking them in person to their county seat. Early in-person voting runs from Oct. 29 through Nov. 6. New Jersey\u2019s biggest bloc of voters is Democratic, followed by unaffiliated voters, then Republicans . Decision Notes AP will tabulate and declare winners in 14 contested elections in New Jersey, including 12 U.S. House seats. In the 2020 general election, AP first reported results at 8:18 p.m. ET Tuesday and 50% of results at 9:42 p.m. ET. AP reported 90% of results on Nov. 12. AP does not make projections or name apparent or likely winners. Only when AP is fully confident a race has been won \u2013 defined most simply as the moment a trailing candidate no longer has a path to victory \u2013 will we make a call. Should a candidate declare victory \u2013 or offer a concession \u2013 before AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that AP has not yet declared a winner and explain the reason why we believe the race is too early or too close to call. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a recount to change the outcome. In New Jersey, candidates may request a recount within 17 days of the election. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2% or if the leading candidate is within 2% of the 50% runoff threshold. AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. The 7th District sequel between Malinowski and Kean is perhaps the most closely watched race in New Jersey. What Else Should I Know? Q: What Did We Learn From the Primary? A: No incumbents lost in the primary, showcasing their usual strength in New Jersey elections and the two major parties\u2019 strength getting their preferred candidates into the general election. Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: New Jersey in 2020 sent mail-in ballots to every registered voter, resulting in a flood of mail ballots that slowed vote counting and reporting of results. The state didn\u2019t report total votes until Nov. 15. New Jersey enacted an early in-person voting measure in 2021, establishing a weeklong period of in-person voting that ends before Election Day. The state also allowed election officials to begin counting mail-in ballots before Election Day. PENNSYLVANIA COURT SAYS UNDATED BALLOTS WON'T BE COUNTED AS RNC CLAIMS \u2018MASSIVE\u2019 LEGAL VICTORY Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: As of Oct. 1, 2022, there were 6,488,266 registered voters in New Jersey, including 2,530,771 Democrats, 1,525,013 Republicans and 2,351,433 unaffiliated. In 2020, more than 4.4 million people cast ballots, compared to 3.87 million in 2016. In 2020, during the height of the pandemic, 94% of votes were cast by mail. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: It\u2019s hard to say because 2020 was an abnormal election. Because of COVID-19, the governor and Legislature chose to send mail ballots to all voters. Then lawmakers changed voting law to provide for early in-person voting in 2021. This year\u2019s election will see a mix of mail, early in-person and Election Day voting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: There is no automatic recount in New Jersey, and candidates would have to finance the cost of one if they sought one. Recounts aren\u2019t a regular feature. Parting Thoughts New Jersey Democrats added Democratic voters in districts that began a decade ago as Republican districts. That could make re-election prospects easier for some incumbents, including Mikie Sherrill in the 11th District and Andy Kim in the 3rd. But they didn\u2019t sure up the 7th District, where the GOP ranks swelled. A good night for House Republicans could include a victory in this swingy district. The state also had a preview of sorts during its statewide race for governor last year. Democratic incumbent Phil Murphy won, as expected, but the contest was much closer than polls indicated. Republicans also picked up seats in the Legislature, and Democrats said they believed the public was most concerned with affordability issues.

So let's break down the remaining teams by who has the most chance of winning it all.", "content": "The next time the Champions League becomes the dominant topic in soccer, we will be approaching Valentine's Day. An entire World Cup will have come and gone. We'll have spent many thousands of words talking about player wear and tear, particularly for players on the four teams that will have played seven matches in Qatar. There is always a winter gap between the Champions League group stage and knockout rounds, but this one is going to feel immense. So before we wave a brief goodbye to the world's biggest club competition, let's take a valedictory look at what we just saw and what we'll see when everything picks up again. As far as group stages go, this one was pretty noteworthy. Napoli romped over supposed group favorites Liverpool and Ajax by a combined 14-4 over three matches, quickly clinching top spot in Group A. Club Brugge were nearly as exciting and creative in winning their first three matches and quickly clinching advancement. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.) LaLiga crashed and burned, with three of its four teams failing to advance -- including not only Atletico Madrid but also Barcelona, who laid down huge chunks of future revenue to upgrade their team and contend again. In solidarity with their Super League brethren, Juventus fell apart as well. Europa League champions Eintracht Frankfurt surprisingly advanced to the knockouts, taking each of their last two matches with winning goals from the electric Randal Kolo Muani. Chelsea fired Thomas Tuchel, engineer of their 2021 title, after a meek loss to Dinamo Zagreb in matchday one. Shakhtar Donetsk, without a home and without most of the stars from recent Europa League runs, had a chance to reach the last 16 with a win over RB Leipzig, only to lose 4-0 and finish third in the group. Celtic and Rangers combined to do very little damage but provided the tournament with some electric atmospheres at Celtic Park and Ibrox Stadium. And then we were left with 16. The squads will change, form will evolve and injuries will shift expectations by the time we see these teams square off. But let's rank teams as they currently stand after two grueling months. If UEFA were to decide, \"You know what? Let's just keep things rolling! The round of 16 starts next week!\" who would the favorites be? Tier 4: The rank outsiders These three teams have achieved a good amount by getting here. They probably aren't equipped for a long stay in the knockout rounds. 16. Club Brugge Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: <1% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +12500 (implied odds: 1%) Best characteristic in group play: Extreme creativity This tournament exposes you to a number of different exciting players and styles, and Brugge's impossibly young attack -- each of their five Champions League goal scorers are between 17 and 23 years old -- was at its most energetic and creative in their 4-0 romp against Porto on Sept. 13. That win, plus their matchday three victory over Atletico Madrid, prompted their eventual advancement to the knockouts, the furthest they've gone in Europe's top competition since reaching the round of 16 in 1989. (They needed only one win to reach said round that year.) - Champions League talking points: Bayern's ruthless run, group stage MVP, more The goals quickly dried up -- they were outscored 4-2 over the final four matches -- as did their ability to create shots at any volume. They finished with the fourth-fewest shots per possession in the tournament. But they also finished fifth in xG per shot. Anything they created was fun and worthwhile. Red flag: Simon Mignolet probably won't continue to stand on his head The wily veteran has been incredible in the tournament, stopping 88% of shots on goal and somehow keeping five clean sheets. Porto's 4-0 revenge win on Oct. 26 was the only time something got through. He was unbelievable, and he allowed Brugge to advance despite opponents averaging more than twice as many shots per possession. As incredible as it would be for both Brugge's and Mignolet's runs to continue, I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that it won't. 15. Eintracht Frankfurt Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: <1% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +10000 (implied odds: 1%) Best characteristic in group play: They don't let you shoot You cannot beat Eintracht Frankfurt with elimination on the line. Die Adler took down Real Betis, Barcelona, West Ham United and Rangers on the way to last year's Europa League title, and after laboring through four group stage matches, they needed two wins to advance... so they got two wins, beating both Marseille and Sporting by 2-1 scores. After a loose first match with Sporting, they allowed zero or one goal in four of five matches, and their shot prevention averages put them in great company. Only four teams allowed 0.09 shots or fewer per possession in group play: Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Eintracht. They turned games into frantic and stingy affairs and navigated the waters better than opponents thanks to sturdy defense and timely creative contributions from Randal Kolo Muani, Daichi Kamada and the delightful Jesper Lindstrom. Red flag: They can't retain the ball Here's some less impressive company. Only four teams averaged 4.2 or fewer passes per possession: Rangers, Viktoria Plzen, Salzburg and Eintracht. Only one of those teams advanced. Eintracht had their aggressive moments, but possession was a problem. That's not going to stop in the knockout rounds. 14. AC Milan Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 2% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +5000 (implied odds: 2%) Best characteristic in group play: A lack of weaknesses I'll be honest: Milan's group stage stats really don't stand out at all. They were neither good nor bad -- in attack, they were 18th in shots per possession and 14th in xG per shot; in defense, they were 15th in shots allowed per possession and eighth in xG allowed per shot. Their goal differential was 10th-best, their xG differential 13th-best. They were one of the 16 best teams in this tournament and therefore advanced. They were also capable of exploiting enough weaknesses against FC Salzburg and Dinamo Zagreb that they advanced despite getting swept by Chelsea. Stars like Olivier Giroud (four goals and two assists) and Rafael Leao (one goal and two assists from 10 chances created) played well, and... I wish I had something more interesting to say. Red flag: No great Plan B With the somewhat old-school (or at least old) Giroud up front, Milan kept things simple, attempting an above-average number of crosses and completing a large percentage of them (30%, fourth-best). And while 22% of their carries were deemed as progressive (second-most), opponents also started 43% of their possessions in the middle third, suggesting things went awry a decent amount there. In all, Milan had certain ways of scoring and certain ways of advancing the ball, and the backup plans weren't there. They were the definition of an above-average team in the group stage. Tier 3: Catch the excitement while you still can The ceiling for these teams is likely the quarterfinals, but they are exciting teams all the same. 13. FC Porto Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 3% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +12500 (implied odds: 1%) Best characteristic in group play: All their shots were high-quality shots Sergio Conceicao's squad suffered through a dismal early-season stretch, dropping too many points in league play and losing their first two Champions League matches, including the 4-0 home stinker to Club Brugge. But they brought the goods when it mattered in group play, winning their last four matches by a combined 11-1 to finish first in a strange Group B. Porto averaged 0.15 xG per shot (second-best), and in terms of post-shot xG value for shots on target, their average was second-best behind only Napoli. Veteran attacker Mehdi Taremi attempted seven shots of 0.2 xG or higher (including two penalties) and put five of them in the net. Red flag: All opponents' shots were high-quality shots Granted, much of the damage was done in their first two matches, but their defensive averages are alarming: They allowed a decent 0.12 shots per possession (ninth), but opponents averaged 0.14 xG per shot (29th). Thirteen percent of opponents' shots were worth 0.3 xG; only Barcelona allowed a higher percentage. Opponents tested the hell out of goalkeeper Diogo Costa, and there are far too many good attacks in the knockout rounds to get away with that. 12. Borussia Dortmund Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 2% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +4500 (implied odds: 2%) Best characteristic in group play: Defensive resilience (for once) It's been an odd first season for Edin Terzic in charge of BVB. Without Erling Haaland, and with an attack remodeled in part around emergency signing Anthony Modeste, this attack- and possession-hungry team has had to adapt a little bit. They're still dominating possession in reasonably flawed fashion during Bundesliga play, but they easily advanced from Group G with defense. Despite playing a pair of matches against Manchester City, BVB ranked seventh in xG per shot allowed and, perhaps most impressively, allowed zero transition goals. Their overall possession rate was just 45% -- a departure from 56% in league play -- and they made it work, hammering Copenhagen at home, taking four points from Sevilla and not only drawing with City once but nearly doing it twice. Red flag: Can they flip the 'be assertive' switch back? Should they? Adaptability is great, but BVB has been plodding along without a clear identity, and one way or the other, you figure Terzic will need to settle in on something in the months ahead. Or he might still be trying to figure it out when the round of 16 rolls around. That doesn't seem like a great thing for their chances of advancing further in this tournament. 11. RB Leipzig Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 2% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +7500 (implied odds: 1%) Best characteristic in group play: Great attackers attacking An early-season funk nearly derailed RBL's hopes of both advancing in the Champions League and qualifying for the next one. But in two months in charge, new manager Marco Rose has at least fixed the former thus far. They won their last four group stage matches, handing Real Madrid their first loss of the season in the process. - Ogden: Leipzig ended Shakhtar's CL dream, but Ukrainian side are still winners In their last four CL matches, Christopher Nkunku, Timo Werner, Andre Silva and Dominik Szoboszlai combined for nine goals and five assists among 33 chances created. Full-backs David Raum and Mohamed Simakan provide assistance in attack (Simakan had three assists), but with Xaver Schlager providing cover for the center-backs, RBL have at least somewhat minimized their defensive breakdowns. Rose didn't reinvent the wheel, but he has thus far given the good version of RBL more of an opportunity to show itself. Red flag: They can still make your attackers great, too Even with Rose in charge for two-thirds of the group stage and things going relatively well, RBL gave opponents too many good looks. Opponents attempted 60% of their shots inside the box (second-most), and 12% of their shots were worth at least 0.3 xG (seventh-most). This appears to be the typical RBL team in all ways good and bad. 10. Inter Milan Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 2% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +4000 (implied odds: 2%) Best characteristic in group play: Their shots were better than your shots Despite two-thirds of their group stage matches coming against either Bayern or Barcelona, Inter averaged a healthy 0.12 xG per shot (10th out of 32), with 59% of their shots coming from inside the box (third). Opponents? They averaged 0.08 xG per shot with 41% of shots in the box -- both were the fewest. And did I mention they played Bayern and Barcelona twice? Simone Inzaghi's Nerazzurri ceded both possession (47% possession rate) and control of the pitch (40% of overall touches in the attacking third) but created most of a given match's good opportunities, often through transition: They scored five goals in what I define as transition possessions -- possessions starting outside of the attacking third and lasting 20 or fewer seconds -- and allowed none. Red flag: Passivity Ceding the field to open up transition opportunities is a strategy as old as the sport itself, and plenty of teams have lifted plenty of trophies because of it. But considering whom Inter would have to beat to make a deep run in the spring, the idea of giving opponents more progressive carries and progressive passes and starting more possessions in the attacking and middle thirds feels like a dicey proposition, especially considering the age of the squad -- nine of the 16 players logging more than 150 Champions League minutes are 28 or older. 9. Tottenham Hotspur Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 3% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +1600 (implied odds: 6%) Best characteristic in group play: They bogged teams down in midfield A finishing slump of sorts nearly derailed Spurs' advancement hopes -- Harry Kane attempted 17 shots worth 3.2 xG but scored only once in six matches -- but they not only survived but also won their group thanks to a late 2-1 win over Marseille on Tuesday. They averaged just 1.3 goals per match (17th), but their xG differential (+0.6 per match) was 10th-best in the group stage. - Breaking down the wild finale to Spurs' Champions League group The biggest thing Spurs had going for them: They were dominant in midfield. They began 45% of their possessions in the middle third (third-most), preventing teams from advancing into attacking areas and therefore commanding 59% of the overall touches in the box. Midfielders Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur, with help from defender Eric Dier, were too much for Marseille, Eintracht Frankfurt and Sporting CP. We'll see if that remains the case against better opposition. Red flag: Dreadful finishing You could almost look at it as a good thing that they advanced with such minimal contribution from Kane, but they will need the A+ version of Kane to advance in the spring. And with Kane captaining one of the World Cup favorites (albeit an English team mired in a slump of late), he could be adding quite a few matches to his legs in the coming weeks. Tier 2: Outside picks to win it all These five teams did enough to advance comfortably despite some lapses (and, in one case, a firing), and, aside from perhaps Benfica, if any of them catch fire in spring and roll to the title, it wouldn't be particularly surprising. 8. Benfica Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 3% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +5000 (implied odds: 2%) Best characteristic in group play: Relentless positivity Last seen leading a swashbuckling PSV Eindhoven team to the Europa League quarterfinals and a near title in the Eredivisie, Roger Schmidt took over a Benfica team suddenly looking for an identity in a much more technical and attack-unfriendly league. Thus far, it has worked out beautifully. Not only are Benfica unbeaten and distancing themselves in the league race but they were also PSG's equal in group play, drawing with the French giants twice, matching from an xG perspective and winning Group H on tiebreakers. They ranked fourth in xG per shot and fifth in percentage of shots worth 0.3 xG or more. They attempted far more solo and transition possessions than most of the other top teams here, and, more generally, they just tried stuff . A lot of it worked. We'll find out about their staying power in the spring, but they took the fight to both PSG and Juventus and looked great doing so. Red flag: Protagonists usually don't win Solo trips and too many transition attempts can catch up to you eventually, especially if you aren't Manchester City or Bayern from an overall talent perspective. Typically, underdogs have to play a more reactive style to advance beyond a certain level of the competition. Benfica and Napoli were maybe the two most exciting and enlightening teams to follow in group play, but the journey's just beginning, and we'll see how long they can keep up. The longer, the better. 7. Chelsea Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 4% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +1400 (implied odds: 7%) Best characteristic in group play: Stinginess You have to respect the old-school Chelsea-ness of it all. You might be banged up and constantly in need of tinkered lineups. You might have already driven your old manager out and brought in a new one (Graham Potter). You might still be trying to find your footing under new ownership. But if your opponents can't score, you can't lose. After the initial loss to Dinamo Zagreb, Chelsea allowed three goals in five matches to clinch advancement. Heading into the final matchday, they ranked first in shots allowed per possession (0.08) and seventh in xG allowed per shot (0.09). There were at least two defenders between shot and goal for 89% of opponents' attempts (second), and no team allowed fewer shots from transition possessions. This was nearly Mourinho-era stinginess. Red flag: Opponents were nearly as stingy As solid as they were in defense, they were equally inconsistent in attack. Through five matches, they ranked 15th in shots per possession (0.15) and 23rd in xG per shot (0.10), with only 6% of their shots generating 0.3 xG or more (21st). They picked up the pace as the competition went on, scoring five goals in two matches against AC Milan, but they have battled similar inconsistency in Premier League play. Potter has a bit more time to experiment and find his optimal lineup, but doing so is a necessity. 6. Liverpool Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 7% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +800 (implied odds: 11%) Best characteristic in group play: They dominated transition Set pieces, too. Liverpool scored seven goals in transition possessions (no one else scored more than five) and allowed just one. They also scored a tournament-best six set-piece goals from nearly five shots per match, while opponents scored none. Transition and set pieces are two of the most opportunistic phases of the game, and while Jurgen Klopp's Reds have struggled to establish traction in Premier League play, their performances in the Champions League -- after the shock-and-awe of their initial 4-1 loss to Napoli, anyway -- suggested that their overall form isn't too far off from their normal standard. Red flag: Opponents didn't need transition to create great looks Playing 180 minutes against the Napoli wrecking ball is going to impact your defensive numbers, but it's still interesting that, despite offering almost nothing in transition, Liverpool allowed opponents to average 0.13 xG per shot, ninth-worst in the competition. As Premier League foes have found, you can break them down in ways you couldn't previously. Klopp could find his optimal lineup between now and February -- and we'll see whom they add in the January transfer window -- but they were somewhat lucky to allow only six goals in the group stage. 5. Paris Saint-Germain Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 8% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +650 (implied odds: 13%) Best characteristic in group play: Push, push, push Leo Messi has begun to look like (the latest evolved version of) Leo Messi again. Neymar is playing his best ball in many years. Kylian Mbappe remains Kylian Mbappe. The midfield, bolstered with youth in the offseason, has energy again. There were some attention span issues in October, but PSG still cruised to qualification, and they did so with, to use American football parlance, a relentless ground game. They attempted 605 carries (first) and completed 113 progressive carries (second) per match. And while teams are often led in carries by central defenders pushing into the empty space in front of them, PSG did it from the front: Neymar completed 94 progressive carries -- more than anyone else in the group stage despite playing in just five of six matches -- while midfielder Marco Verratti (83) was second and Mbappe (80) was third. Overall, they pushed the ball into dangerous areas, then put it in the net: the Mbappe-Messi-Neymar trio combined for 13 goals and nine assists from 38 chances created. And neither Messi nor Neymar played in every match. Red flag: No big chances somehow As we learned in last year's Champions League final, singular huge chances are worth their weight in gold in a knockout competition, and while PSG's attacking numbers were mostly unassailable, it's worth noting that only 5% of their shot attempts were worth 0.3 xG or more. Only eight teams created a lower percentage, and only one of those teams advanced in the competition. 4. Real Madrid Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 8% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +1100 (implied odds: 8%) Best characteristic in group play: They created chances at will After creating some adversity for themselves early in last season's eventual title run, the defending champs made things easy for themselves this time, winning their first three matches and clinching advancement quickly. They did it primarily with wave after wave of close-range shots. Real Madrid not only averaged 0.24 shots per possession (second to only Manchester City) but also attempted 59% of their shots in the box (fourth). They also averaged 3.8 shots per match on set pieces, well ahead of everyone else but Liverpool. Their actual scoring numbers were merely fine, in part because of a brief finishing slump from Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema (14 shots, 1.5 xG created, zero goals), but it's difficult to worry too much about this \"create tons of excellent looks for your ridiculously talented attackers\" plan. Red flag: They relied too much on Real Madrid Magic They were tied with RB Leipzig until the 80th minute in matchday two before scoring twice. They were trailing Shakhtar until the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time in matchday four until Antonio Rudiger came through with a bloody header to tie. Their goal differential in the first 60 minutes was a mediocre +0.2 per match until their blowout of Celtic on the final matchday, but it rose to +0.8 in the final 30. They basically rode this recipe to a Champions League win last year, but it's an approach that can let you down at inopportune times. Tier 1-A: The most dominant, most fun team We'll grant honorary top-tier status to maybe the most purely dominant team of these six matches, one that got younger, cheaper and much, much better (and more fun) this offseason. 3. Napoli Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 5% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +1200 (implied odds: 8%) Best characteristic in group play: Perfection in the attacking third Perhaps no team in Europe is in better form than Luciano Spalletti's Azzurri , who had won 13 matches in a row in all competitions -- and hadn't lost since last April -- before their meaningless 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday. They were ruthless in the group stage, scoring at least three goals in every match until Tuesday. - Karlsen's Champions League breakout XI: Kvaratskhelia, Diogo Costa, more New additions Giovanni Simeone (Hellas Verona), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Dinamo Batumi), Giacomo Raspadori (Sassuolo) and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa (Fulham) combined for 11 goals and eight assists from 20 chances created, and Napoli ranked both third in shots per possession (0.19) and first in xG per shot (0.15) with 13% of their shots generating 0.3 xG or more (second). And again: That's with a shutout loss in their meaningless final match! Napoli were a must-watch, and the longer they remain in the competition, the better. Red flag: They give the ball up a lot in dangerous areas If you want to know how Napoli will likely be eliminated from the competition, note some giveaway numbers: Opponents began 9% of their possessions in the attacking third (11th-most) and 46% in the middle third (fifth-most). Napoli were so delightful in the attacking third that it perhaps distracted us from the fact that opponents were creating more touches there than they were. Tier 1: OK, it's probably going to be one of these two teams winning it all We end with the two teams that began the competition as co-favorites and have given us no reason to remove them from that perch since the season began. 2. Bayern Munich Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 24% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +450 (implied odds: 18%) Best characteristic in group play: No one controls the middle more No one controls the group stage more, too. Despite playing in the perceived group of death with Inter and Barcelona, Bayern swept their six matches for the third straight season. They did it in Bayern fashion, seizing control of matches quickly (average time of first goal: 23rd minute) and creating high-quality chances nonstop. As far as best characteristics go, however, \"They're Bayern\" didn't really do it for me. So let's focus on something unique: No one dominated the middle of the pitch like the German champs. They attempted just 9.7 crosses per match (second-fewest to only Shakhtar), their average possession width was just 32.8 meters (fourth-lowest), and 30% of their touches in the attacking third came from the middle third of the pitch (third-highest). That's also where nine of their 15 assists and 48 of their 82 chances created (six from Sadio Mane, five each from midfielders Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich) came from. If you can't stop Bayern from coming at you right up the guts, you can't stop Bayern. Red flag: Their shots were a little too accurate It's worth pointing out that while they ranked fourth in xG per shot, they ranked a distant first in putting 49% of their shots on target. Meanwhile, opponents did so with only 28% of their shots, second-lowest. They are obviously one of the co-favorites no matter what, but that ratio will almost certainly shift in the spring. 1. Manchester City Title odds, per FiveThirtyEight's SPI: 25% Title odds, per Caesars Sportsbook: +190 (implied odds: 34%) Best characteristic in group play: They remain the best passing team on the planet In other words, they remain Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. They enjoyed a 66% possession rate (highest in the group stage), engineered 80% of their matches' touches in the attacking third (first), completed 91 progressive passes per match (most) and allowed just 24 progressive passes per match (fewest). No one suffocates their opponents and the match itself like the Sky Blues. Red flag: Not enough high-quality shots? While the addition of Erling Haaland earned plenty of headlines and created a focal point in attack for City -- he scored five of their 10 goals in the four matches he played -- it's interesting to note that while they ranked seventh in xG per shot, they also created only 50% of their shots in the box, 19th. Most other primary contenders topped that, and teams such as Bayern, Napoli, Liverpool and PSG put more of their shots on target and scored more. - Rico Lewis, 17, breaks Benzema's Champions League record We can quibble with the quality of each team's groups or the number of packed-in defenses each team saw, but even in Premier League play, City's attack hasn't really improved with Haaland -- they've scored 37 goals in 12 EPL matches this year after scoring 36 in their last 12 of last season. Maybe having a focal point in tight, important matches will pay off down the line, though?", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-16.29602813720703, -13.613816261291504]}, {"title": "Even left-leaning media calls out Democrats like Katie Hobbs dodging debates: 'Don't you have an obligation?'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/even-left-leaning-media-calls-democrats-katie-hobbs-dodging-debates-obligation", "description": "Liberal journalists pressed Katie Hobbs to answer for why she won't debate Kari Lake in Arizona's governor's race, as other Democrats make the same decision.", "content": "close Video Liberal media figures press Democrats to defend not debating Republican opponents Journalists and commentators at ABC and CNN criticized Democrats who wouldn't debate their Republican challengers in the November 8 election.

The Democrat told ABC that \"the debate about debates is over.\" Katie Hobbs defended her refusal to debate Kari Lake while appearing on \"GMA3: What You Need To Know\" Friday (ABC) \"I\u2019m running my campaign the way I\u2019m running my campaign. I\u2019m going to continue to make the case directly to voters,\" she added. Co-host T.J. Holmes pressed the Democrat, to no avail, to \"stand up\" for her voters. He compared Lake to a \"bully.\" \"[P]eople are putting somebody in that office that they want to stand up and fight for them. At worst, it could come off as you\u2019re scared to step on that stage. At best, you\u2019re not willing to confront,\" Holmes said. \"We\u2019re in a new era where sometimes, some politicians have been seen as bullies, and we\u2019ve been taught since we were little kids that you got to stand up to a bully. You understand how that might come across? How do you make the case that we want to send you to fight for us, but you won\u2019t even stand on stage with her?\" FILE: Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs speaks at a roundtable event in Phoenix, Monday, Sept. 19, 2022.

Asked if there were \"any conditions\" in which she'd agree to a debate, Hobbs said she preferred talking to voters through one-on-one interviews. She claimed Lake would make any debate a \"circus.\" Lake rejected that reasoning to Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. The Republican accused Hobbs of refusing to debate her because she \"can't even string a couple of words together,\" referring to Hobbs fumbling a question about the Latino community. \"It would be like a birthday cake versus a chainsaw,\" Lake added.

In other races, Democrats and Republicans have come to an impasse over the debate terms. In Virginia's competitive 7th congressional district, Democrat incumbent Abigail Spanberger allegedly backed out of a previously agreed upon debate. Her campaign objected to the organizer's initial moderator choice, conservative radio host Larry O'Connor. Debate organizers also cited Spanberger's campaign not being satisfied with the amount of security detail that would be present at the event. Her opponent, Republican Yesli Vega , argued Spanberger had backed out of the event so she wouldn't have to answer questions about her ties to another Virginia Democrat who proposed a law that would criminalize parents who did not affirm their child's gender identity or sexuality. Yesli Vega told Fox News Digital that her opponent backed out of the debate because she couldn't defend her agenda or record. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images) \"Abigail Spanberger knew she couldn\u2019t defend her anti-parent agenda or her failed record that has led to skyrocketing inflation and out of control crime. That\u2019s why she backed out of our debate, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m going to win on November 8th,\" Vega told Fox News Digital. Spanberger's campaign blamed her opponent for \"stalling the debate into nonexistence\" in a statement to The Washington Post . \"Due to the Vega campaign\u2019s pressure to corrupt the [debate organizer] Prince William Committee of 100\u2019s efforts and stall the debate into nonexistence, with just five days to go before the scheduled debate, it became increasingly clear a debate was never going to become a reality.\" Former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt is the GOP nominee running to unseat incumbent Sen.

The student who allegedly owned the notebook has been sent to an alternative school , but some parents said 20 days in that environment would not be enough to make students feel safe or to help the one who made the threats. \"We deeply and humbly apologize for all the emotional and mental distress experienced by our students, parents and staff,\" board president Kathy Brown wrote in a newsletter to parents following the probe. \"It is painful and we want to work towards healing, and that includes every single student.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Principal Tim Salem was placed on administrative leave shortly after the case became public.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "foxnews", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [7.526238441467285, 7.766425132751465]}, {"title": "The Speaker\u2019s Lobby: Protecting Congress", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speakers-lobby-protecting-congress", "description": "The attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will reignite debate about how to keep the families of members of Congress safe.", "content": "close Video Paul Pelosi attacker faces another day in court, officials reviewing security protocols after attack Fox News\u2019 Claudia Cowan reports on updates in the Paul Pelosi attack as the suspected attacker faces another day in court Friday and officials investigate security failings leading up to the attack. \"Chad, this building is secure.\" Those were the words from a top congressional security official to yours truly about the U.S. Capitol in 2008. The U.S. Capitol may have been secure 14 years ago. But few are convinced that\u2019s the case now after last year\u2019s riot. However, security of the building isn\u2019t the only issue top of mind for the U.S. Capitol Police these days. The question is how do they ensure the safety of 535 lawmakers \u2013 and now, their families. The word \"Congress\" means \"coming together.\" In fact, it may be lot easier for security officials to protect lawmakers when Congress comes together into session in Washington and most lawmakers are roaming about the Capitol grounds. US CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS WEREN'T WATCHING LIVE HOME SECURITY CAMERAS WHEN PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED The challenge is safeguarding lawmakers at their homes in Washington, in their districts, and when they maneuver around their states and districts campaigning at county fairs and delivering speeches to neighborhood associations. And then there are the families. The deranged assault on Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reignited a serious conversation about the safety of lawmakers. In fact, lawmaker security precautions will likely be the central debate on Capitol Hill when Congress reconvenes after the midterm elections.

(Dimitrios Kambouris/VF15/WireImage ; Fox News ) \"We believe today\u2019s political climate calls for more resources to provide additional layers of physical security for Members of Congress,\" said U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger in a rare and lengthy statement. \"This plan would include an emphasis on adding redundancies to the measures that are already in place for Congressional leadership.\" Manger describes the current atmosphere as a \"time of heightened political tension.\" He says the USCP is monitoring \"thousands of cases across the country \u2013 in an effort to stop potential threats before they make headlines.\" Manger wants lawmakers to give his department more money so he can protect lawmakers better. PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: DAVID DEPAPE WAS ON 'SUICIDE MISSION' DURING ALLEGED ATTACK, TARGETED OTHER POLITICIANS Funding for the U.S. Capitol Police increased exponentially in recent years. The money began flowing immediately after 9/11. The USCP needed fortifications to protect the Capitol against a potential terrorist attack. Then came the 2011 shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and the baseball practice shooting of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise , R-La., in 2017. Credible threats to lawmakers rose at an alarming pace over the past six years. The USCP probed 10,000 threats to lawmakers last year. That\u2019s more than double the number compared to 2018. In his department\u2019s annual spending request, Manger requested an increase of $105.5 million for Fiscal Year 2023. The House Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee crafted a measure in June which would spend $708 million on the USCP. That\u2019s up 17.5% from Fiscal Year 2022. Rep. Steve Scalise delivers remarks during a Republican-led forum on COVID-19 at the U.S. Capitol on June 29, 2021. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Congress still hasn\u2019t approved a full complement of spending bills for the entire federal government for fiscal year 2023. Congress must OK some form of spending measure to keep the government operating beyond mid-December. One can anticipate a push for even more spending for the U.S. Capitol Police in an overall government funding package for Fiscal 2023 or even a short-term bill to avert a government shutdown just before Christmas. In recent years, the U.S. Capitol Police has expanded its footprint well beyond Capitol Hill. It\u2019s set up field offices in some locales around the country. The department now works directly with local police agencies to help protect members. Hiring has been an issue. The USCP lost around 140 officers after the Capitol riot. The department was still hundreds of officers short in the spring. In his statement after the Paul Pelosi attack, Manger says the USCP is on track to hire 280 officers. But here\u2019s the problem: it is really hard to protect 535 people flung all around the country at all times. PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: 'MENTALLY ILL' SUSPECT PREVIOUSLY LIVED WITH JAILED 'NUDIST' LOVER, 'CONSTANTLY PARANOID' In fact, various congressional security authorities have told Fox that some rank-and-file members \u2013 who have never faced a serious threat \u2013 have pleaded for the department to provide a full protective detail for them and their families. That is logistically impossible \u2013 without spending billions of dollars. The top leaders in the House and Senate, majority and minority, automatically get a detail. That includes Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D.

Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., receives a detail because he is the president pro tempore, the most-senior member of the Senate\u2019s majority party. That means Leahy is third in line to the presidency behind Vice President Kamala Harris and Pelosi. DEMS BLAME ATTACK ON GOP RHETORIC THAT TURNED PELOSI INTO A TARGET Those members have security around them all the time. They are driven to and from events in dark Suburbans by USCP \"special agents.\" In fact, the protective detail with Scalise the day of the baseball practice shooting likely saved the whip\u2019s life \u2013 as well as the lives of other lawmakers on the field. The USCP periodically assign temporary security details to lawmakers who face significant threats. Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn., is often spotted around the Capitol with protection. The USCP also assigned officers to guard members of the 1/6 committee. Many years ago, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., scored a police detail for a few days after someone sent him a letter laced with ricin. A police detail protected Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., several years ago after a potential threat to kill him emerged from Venezuela . Following the Scalise shooting, the House Administration Committee expanded the list of items and services on which lawmakers could spend congressional funds to enhance their own security. As recently as August, the House sergeant at arms rolled out a program where lawmakers could spend $10,000 for their homes. Rep. Cori Bush leaves a processing area after being arrested for participating in a sit-in with activists (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Each office receives a general pot of money it can spend on everything from printers to staff salaries. Security-related expenditures are now on the rise. Moreover, some lawmakers, like Rep. Cori Bush , R-Mo., are often seen around the Capitol with their own private security. This is ironic. Bush has caught flak for employing her own security in light of her boisterous rhetoric to \"defund the police.\" Crime is a major issue for lawmakers ahead of the midterm elections. But what few anticipated was that crime would be an issue for lawmakers themselves. It may be a challenge for USCP to intensify security around 535 lawmakers and their families. Sheer wherewithal and personnel are a factor. There aren\u2019t enough video cameras, alarm systems and guns to do so.

A dynamic and widely-respected soccer player, he starred on Colombian club teams and was a leader on the country\u2019s ascendant national team\u2013culminating with a spot in the 1994 World Cup. In a group stage match against the host United States, Escobar scored an own goal that led to an American victory. Two weeks later, he was murdered by a gunman who shouted \u201cGOAL!\u201d after each shot, an apparent retaliation for the goal. In the new Netflix miniseries The Final Score, these event\u2013and Escobar\u2019s life leading up to them\u2013are given a dramatic recreation. Opening Shot: In 1994, a newscaster relays the shocking news: Andr\u00e9s Escobar has been killed by an assassin, an apparent retaliation for the soccer star\u2019s inadvertent own-goal against the United States in that year\u2019s World Cup. Viewers\u2013friends, family and teammates of Escobar among them\u2013sob as they learn the news. Then, we rewind through a montage of recent Colombian history\u2013both the success of the national team, and the brutal rise of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medellin Cartel, finally arriving in 1987, where the story starts. The Gist: The story of Andr\u00e9s Escobar\u2019s death is well-known around the world, but the story of his life isn\u2019t as well-known. Giving context to the tragic star\u2019s life is a large part of The Final Score , and the six-part miniseries\u2013broadcast in Spanish with English subtitles\u2013has time to get there, fleshing out both the personalities in Escobar\u2019s life and the political and social situation of Colombia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The program was produced in Colombia and features a cast of well-known Colombian actors\u2013this isn\u2019t an outsider\u2019s perspective on the story. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? In dramatizing the story of a real-life figure in the world of international soccer, it calls to mind the recent Diego Maradona-focused Argentine miniseries Maradona: Blessed Dream . But American viewers might also recall one of the most celebrated episodes of ESPN\u2019s long-running 30 For 30 series, \u201cThe Two Escobars,\u201d which told the same story as The Final Score in more straightforward documentary format. Our Take: Even if you\u2019re not an avid soccer fan, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re familiar with the broad outlines of the tragic story of Andr\u00e9s Escobar. His death lingers as one of the central stories of the 1994 World Cup, and brought Colombia\u2019s brutal drug wars of the 1980s and 1990s into even starker public view. But there\u2019s always more to the story than the headlines, and The Final Score does an admirable job of telling a story that\u2019s nuanced and respectful of its subject matter while also being compelling as a television drama. There\u2019s a risk in over-stretching a story like this beyond the length its details can support, but the six-episode format of The Final Score is just right, even for a casual viewer. It\u2019s just long enough to become invested in the characters involved\u2013from Escobar himself to his manager, Francisco Maturana, to immediately-recognizable teammate Ren\u00e9 Higuita\u2013without dawdling or bogging the story down too much. The show doesn\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t know how the story ends, starting with a montage of many of the characters reacting to the news of Escobar\u2019s death. But it quickly rewinds, showing Escobar\u2019s early days struggling for playing time, and Maturana\u2019s struggles to build a successful team. Beyond that, we\u2019re introduced to the dangerous situation in Colombia at the time, with Pablo (no relation) Escobar\u2019s Medellin Cartel rising to power amidst a campaign of staggering brutality and wanton murder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t football anymore, it\u2019s a war!\u201d, team owner Octavio Agudelo barks at manager Maturana during a tense scene mid-episode. The music throbs, and Maturana\u2019s face goes ashen. In The Final Score, we learn that the stakes for soccer can be far bigger than trophies\u2013it can be a matter of life or death. Sex and Skin: At one point, Escobar is seen in bed with a girlfriend, but there\u2019s no sex or actual nudity. Parting Shot: After a tense\u2013and extremely-high-stakes\u2013win for Atl\u00e9tico Nacional over arch-rival Am\u00e9rica de Cali\u2013manager Francisco Maturana heads into the club\u2019s offices, planning to tender his resignation after seeing how tightly the club has become enmeshed in the country\u2019s drug war. He arrives to somber faces, as he learns that club owner Octavio Agudelo has been murdered the previous night. Sleeper Star: The cast is strong throughout, but take special note of the performance of John Alex Castillo as manager Francisco Maturana. A former player who became manager of Escobar at Atl\u00e9tico Nacional and would later lead the national team, he brings a solemn gravitas to the task of building a team that can make his country proud. Most Pilot-y Line: \u201cGive me five matches,\u201d Maturana implores in asking for control of his team, a bit of foreshadowing given his well-known success. \u201cIf the team isn\u2019t working, I\u2019ll quit.

It's there to protect people,\" he said in a conversation recorded on bodycam. \"The reason why they don't give us discretion on these things is because too many times women at risk want to go back to their abuser, they just wanted him to stop, they don't want to have to be separated, they don't want him to be charged, they don't want him to go to jail, and then they end up getting worse and worse treatment and end up getting killed.\" Moab Police Officer Eric Pratt, in bodycam footage released by investigators, is seen speaking to Brian Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021.

Twitter began offering one companywide paid rest day per month, in addition to normal paid time off, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy was meant to help reduce burnout among staffers. But Musk has eliminated future \u201cdays of rest\u201d from Twitter\u2019s calendar this week, sources familiar with the situation told Bloomberg . The move came as Musk swiftly overhauls Twitter\u2019s workplace culture after completing his $44 billion deal to buy the firm last week. The Post has reached out to Twitter for comment on the change. Musk interrupted one of Twitter\u2019s \u201cdays of rest\u201d even before he became the company\u2019s owner and CEO. In April, employees reportedly learned that Musk had rejected an offer to take a seat on Twitter\u2019s board of directors just before a scheduled day off \u2014 a development that left workers stressed out instead of relaxed. The policy change is the latest indication that Musk will set new standards for Twitter\u2019s internal culture during an ongoing reshuffling effort. Musk is reportedly planning to lay off about half of Twitter\u2019s 7,500-employee workforce, with impacted workers expected to learn their fate on Friday, according to Bloomberg. The cost-cutting effort was widely expected as Musk expressed concern that he had overpaid for the company. In another major internal shift, Musk is reportedly planning to end Twitter\u2019s remote work policy and require employees who aren\u2019t laid off to report to the company\u2019s offices. The billionaire had previously enacted a strict return-to-office policy at his electric car firm Tesla. Meanwhile, some Twitter employees were reportedly told to prepare to work \u201c24/7\u201d earlier this week to hit Musk\u2019s Friday deadline for a revamped \u201cTwitter Blue\u201d service. The Twitter CEO plans to charge users $8 per month for \u201cblue check\u201d verification badges and other perks. Employees are purportedly concerned that they would be out of a job if they were unable to meet the deadline.

Fuller, former hospital electrician from East Sussex, was sentenced to a whole-life term \u2014 the British equivalent of life in prison without the possibility of parole \u2014 last year after he pleaded guilty to killing and then sexually assaulting two young women in 1987.

Starring Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and Michaela Cole, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is definitely going to be action packed, and you won\u2019t want to miss it. So how do you watch this film? Will it be on Disney+? We\u2019ve got all the answers below so read on to learn more. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is being released into theaters starting November 11. You can find showtimes for a theater near you on Fandago . Although Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is not streaming on Disney+ on November 11, chances are it should be there sooner, rather than later. Marvel movies tend to stream on the service anywhere from 45 days later, to a few months later, with streaming dates TBA depending on the movie\u2019s performance. For example, Thor: Love and Thunder was released in theaters on July 8, 2022 and was available to stream on Disney + beginning September 8 \u2014 slightly delayed to time out with this year\u2019s Disney+ Day celebrations. On the other hand, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of M adness was released in theaters on May 6, 2022 and arrived on Disney+ 45 days later, on June 20. The other little caveat is that Disney usually likes to time the movie releases out with one of their big streaming days \u2014 Wednesday for new shows, Friday for movies. Given this, it\u2019s possible Black Panther: Wakanda Forever could start streaming on Friday, December 30, just in time for New Year\u2019s Eve. Alternately, if Disney wants to release it a little earlier, the movie could hit 44 days later, on December 25 as a Christmas surprise. Or, if the movie is performing extremely well in theaters, as expected, it\u2019s possible the movie could be released for streaming outside of the 45 day window, some time in January, 2023. Short version, expect Black Panther: Wakanda Forever to hit Disney+ at the earliest end of December, 2022, and latest some time in January, 2023. Unfortunately, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will not be released onto HBO Max, as it is a Disney movie and not a Warner Bros. film. Traditionally, Warner Bros. movies are usually released onto the streaming service, with Don\u2019t Worry Darling coming to the platform next week. Sadly, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will not be streaming on Netflix and will only be available to stream on Disney+ after its theatrical run.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A 73-year-old convicted sex offender has been charged in connection with the 1966 disappearance and death of a 10-year-old Massachusetts girl , a prosecutor said Thursday. Donald Mars was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Betty Lou Zukowski, who left her Chicopee home on the evening of May 26, 1966 and was found beaten to death several days later in the Westfield River in West Springfield, prosecutors said in Hampden Superior Court in Springfield. A not guilty plea was entered on Mars' behalf. MASSACHUSETTS POLICE ARREST MAN SUSPECTED OF BREAKING INTO COLLEGE STUDENTS' APARTMENTS His attorney did not object to his client being held without bail, but retained the right to seek bail at a later date. An email seeking comment was left with the defense. \"While this investigation will not bring Betty Lou back to her family, or grant her the opportunity to grow into a healthy adult that she and every child deserves, it is for them and for Betty Lou that we embark upon this journey of seeking justice,\" Hampden District Attorney Anthony Gulluni said at a news conference after the arraignment. Betty's Lou's parents, Stanley and Mildred, have died but authorities have been in touch with surviving members of her family, he said. The cause of death in the then 10-year-old girl, Betty Lou Zukowski, was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head, a skull fracture and terminal drowning, according to investigators. The victim left her family's Chicopee home after taking a phone call from what she told her parents was a girlfriend, Gulluni said. Her parents reported her missing later that night. Her \"beaten and mud-covered 4-foot-7 inch, 75-pound body was found just offshore by boys fishing in the Westfield River in the town of West Springfield,\" he said. \"The cause of the death was determined by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be multiple blunt force injuries to her head, a skull fracture and terminal drowning,\" he said.

Mars, who would have been a teenager at the time of Betty Lou's death, was linked to the killing as long ago as 1997 but was not arrested, Gulluni said. Gulluni's cold case unit refocused on the case in the last few months, he said, although he did not disclose what evidence led to Mars.

The king is known to have an outrageous list of demands , but it was recently revealed that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like square ice cubes\u201d and, like any 5-year-old boy, Charles \u201ctravels with a childhood teddy bear.\u201d Christopher Andersen, the author of \u201c The King: The Life of Charles III ,\u201d said that the beloved bear has been by Charles\u2019 side since he was a \u201cvery small child.\u201d It was even guarded by one of Charles\u2019 most trusted valets, Michael Fawcett, who was in charge of caring for the beloved bear well into the king\u2019s adulthood, Andersen told \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d Whenever the toy needed mending, a designated nanny made the necessary repairs, the writer added. \u201cThe only person who\u2019s been allowed to mend King Charles\u2019 teddy bear is his childhood nanny, Mabel Anderson, who he remains very close to,\u201d Andersen said. This tune-up would occur when Charles \u201cwas well into his 40s, and every time that teddy needed to be repaired, you would think it was his own child having major surgery,\u201d Fawcett says in the book. Fawcett was also in charge of squeezing toothpaste onto the former prince\u2019s monogrammed toothbrush, shaving his face, helping him put his pants on and tying his shoes, Andersen said. At night, he laid out Charles\u2019 pajamas and got his bed ready for a peaceful slumber. Another valet, Ken Stronach, claims that before Charles dozed off, Stronach would tuck the adult prince into bed each night and leave him snuggled up with his beloved teddy, Andersen\u2019s book claimed. But the royal isn\u2019t always cute and cuddly. \u201cFor someone who said he was bullied as a child, Prince Charles clearly enjoyed bullying us,\u201d a Highgrove staffer told Andersen. \u201cHe could be pleasant and courteous, but just as much of the time, he was moody and mean,\u201d the source claimed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think twice about shouting insults at you if you put a foot wrong.\u201d Stronach also spoke of the king\u2019s brutal behavior, claiming he saw Charles grab a heavy wooden bootjack and throw it at Princess Diana, narrowly missing her head, in the midst of an argument with his then-wife. Another time, while visiting a friend\u2019s villa in the South of France, Charles allegedly had an angry meltdown when one of his cuff links fell down a bathroom sink. \u201cFlying into a blind rage, he pulled the sink off the wall, then smashed it, looking for the cuff link,\u201d Andersen writes. \u201cUnable to find the missing jewelry, a wild-eyed Prince of Wales spun around and grabbed his valet by the throat. Stronach broke free, darted out a side door \u2014 and into a linen closet. Terrified, he huddled there for 30 minutes before he could hear Charles leave the bathroom.\u201d The sink wasn\u2019t the only piece of property that Charles destroyed in a fit of rage. \u201cOnce, while a guest at a friend\u2019s country home, Charles wanted some fresh air,\u201d Andersen claimed. \u201cUnable to open the window, he picked up a chair and smashed it open. Not satisfied with the results, he smashed another.\u201d \u201cYou have to understand,\u201d Stronach said, \u201cthe prince is accustomed to getting what he wants. And he wanted some fresh air.\u201d While inviting Charles over may come with the possibility that your property will be demolished in a tantrum, the royal is sure to bring his own property as well, including a porcelain throne fit for a king. The royal is rumored to travel with a custom-made toilet seat, his favorite toilet paper, ice trays and personal chef. \u201cWhen he goes to dinner parties at other people\u2019s homes he often brings his own chef, so they can prepare a meal for him that he\u2019ll eat separately at the table,\u201d Andresen writes.

The 2022 World Series continues to be a roller coaster. After getting stormed in Game 3, the Houston Astros looked like they could be in a tough spot, needing a win against Phillies ace Aaron Nola at Citizens Bank Park to get back into the best-of-7. Not only did the Astros win, but they did it in historic fashion by throwing a combined no-hitter . Houston\u2019s victory has flipped the odds back in its favor, as the Astros are now -180 favorites to win the World Series ahead of Game 5, which will feature perhaps the biggest pitching mismatch of the series: Justin Verlander vs. Noah Syndergaard (and the Phillies bullpen).

AZ, CT, IA, IL, LA, MI, NJ, NY, PA, TN, WV, WY only. T&C apply Justin Verlander is one of the best pitchers of his generation, and he\u2019s got a ring, but his World Series record is quite peculiar. The 39-year-old is 0-6 with a 6.07 ERA and 1.33 WHIP in eight starts in the Fall Classic. It\u2019s likely more noise than anything else but is an interesting note as he heads into a pivotal outing for the Astros. Verlander is a near-lock to win the AL Cy Young after posting a 1.75 ERA and 0.83 WHIP in the regular season, but his postseason has been a bit rocky. Verlander owns a 7.20 ERA in 15 postseason innings and has struggled with walks and home runs (relative to his regular season numbers) in October. And even though he did struggle in his first start against the Phillies, he should match up well against a lineup that is aggressive and isn\u2019t a stranger to striking out. Verlander\u2019s counterpart, Noah Syndergaard, will likely be asked to turn over the Astros lineup once before giving way to a bullpen that was called into action more than Rob Thomson would have liked the night before a bullpen game. Jose Alvarado, Andrew Bellatti, David Robertson, Zach Eflin, and Brad Hand all pitched in Game 4, but only Alvarado threw more than 16 pitches. Bellatti is probably the only reliever who won\u2019t be available, as he\u2019s pitched two nights in a row. Houston tapped Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly on Wednesday, but none threw more than 19 pitches, and each should be ready to back up Verlander. Handicapping a bullpen game, especially in a World Series, is not an easy task, but it does seem like there\u2019s some betting value on the Astros to put together another rout on Thursday. Syndergaard is far from a sure thing to get through the Astros order unscathed and the Phillies bullpen doesn\u2019t have the high-end talent to be an imposing force against this lineup. Verlander\u2019s World Series record is certainly weird, but it shouldn\u2019t keep bettors away from Houston if that\u2019s where they see value.

The hospital worker who tipped off the cops told them that she had gone into the ICU room that night to check on a patient, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the station Fox 31. When she entered the room, she noticed that the lights were turned off and the curtain was drawn around the bed. When the woman opened the curtain, she said, she discovered the patient lying unconscious with her hospital gown pulled up to reveal her breasts, and the bed cover pulled down showing her genitals. According to the complainant, she saw Lambros with his head resting on the patient\u2019s stomach with a phone in his hand in a position suggesting he was snapping a selfie. The document stated that when Lambros saw the colleague enter the room, he dropped his phone and covered up the patient. When interviewed by investigators, Lambros claimed he was giving the patient an injection to prevent blood clots, which is administered in the stomach area, explaining why the woman\u2019s body was uncovered.

The mountain is seen here in 2009. In North America and around the globe, 50 UNESCO World Heritage sites are home to glaciers. A new study warns that glaciers in a third of them will disappear by 2050 due to carbon emissions warming the planet. The other two-thirds can still be saved \u2014 but only if global temperatures don't exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times, UNESCO says. World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding natural and cultural heritage, and that world leaders have thus agreed to protect. UNESCO's report , released ahead of the COP27 climate conference starting Sunday in Egypt, is bracing. About 18,600 glaciers are found in World Heritage sites, and they represent about a tenth of the glacierized area on Earth \u2014 but they are shrinking quickly. The glaciers in these 50 sites are losing some 58 billion tons of ice each year, and contribute to almost 5% of observed sea level rise globally. The last remaining glaciers in Africa are predicted to melt by 2050, including those at Kilimanjaro National Park and Mount Kenya. The fastest melting glaciers on the list are those at Three Parallel Rivers National Park in China's Yunnan province. Glaciers there have already lost more than 57% of their mass since 2000. In the U.S., the glaciers in Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks will likely have disappeared by 2050. The glaciers found along the U.S.-Canadian border at the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park have already lost more than a quarter of their volume in the last 20 years. Other endangered glaciers include those in Italy's Dolomites, France's Pyrenees, Argentina's Los Alerces National Park, Peru's Huascar\u00e1n National Park, and New Zealand's Te Wahipounamu. The melting glaciers have an impact not only on the environment, but on people, said Bruno Oberle, director-general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in a statement released Thursday. \" When glaciers melt rapidly, millions of people face water scarcity and the increased risk of natural disasters such as flooding, and millions more may be displaced by the resulting rise in sea levels,\" Oberle said. \"This study highlights the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and invest in Nature-based Solutions, which can help mitigate climate change and allow people to better adapt to its impacts,\" he added. As the world's climate leaders gather for COP27, UNESCO is calling for the creation of an international fund for glacier monitoring and preservation that would support research, strengthen ties between stakeholders, and implement disaster risk and early warning measures. \"This report is a call to action,\" UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said in statement. \"Only a rapid reduction in our CO 2 emissions levels can save glaciers and the exceptional biodiversity that depends on them.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [9.318647384643555, -4.159254550933838]}, {"title": "The EPA awards grants to monitor air quality in communities hurt by pollution", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1134017574/epa-air-quality-monitoring-states", "description": "Dozens of projects will receive millions to boost monitoring near industrial sites.

WASHINGTON \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday awarded grants for projects to monitor air quality in 37 states, with a focus on minority communities and other areas overburdened by pollution. A total of 132 projects will receive $53.4 million to enhance air quality monitoring near chemical plants, refineries and other industrial sites \u2014 part of a commitment by the Biden administration to focus on environmental justice in communities adversely affected by decades of industrial pollution. The grants are funded by the sweeping climate and health law approved in August and the coronavirus relief plan approved by Congress last year. \"This money is headed where it's needed most,'' EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. The newly funded projects \"will ensure dozens of overburdened communities have the tools they need to better understand air quality challenges in their neighborhoods and will help protect people from the dangers posed by air pollution,\" he said. Eight projects being funded are in neighborhoods that Regan visited on what he calls a \"Journey to Justice\" tour of communities plagued by long-term pollution. \"All people, no matter where they live, deserve clean water and clean air and the opportunity to live a healthy life,'' said Regan, the first Black man to head the EPA. The grants follow enforcement actions announced by Regan in January to conduct unannounced inspections of chemical plants, refineries and other industrial sites in three Gulf Coast states suspected of polluting air and water and causing health problems to nearby residents. Recipients include the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, a New Orleans-based advocacy group that has pushed for stricter federal oversight of an 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch from New Orleans to Baton Rouge officially known as the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor but more commonly called Cancer Alley. The region contains several hotspots where cancer risks are far above levels deemed acceptable by the EPA. The group will receive nearly $500,000 to help community groups monitor their air quality and \"become more active and effective in civic engagement,'' the EPA said.

The homeless living at the park , however, were given a week\u2019s notice to leave the area and were offered stays at a shelter. A Parks and Recreation spokesperson told the outlet that they cannot remember the last time a mayor has made such a decision, while some residents and activists in the area are scratching their heads over the move. \u200b\u200b\u201dThese people have to find a place to stay warm and that night, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d homeless advocate Pat Schwiebert told Fox 12. \u201cThe part where they have been staying, they chose that because it wasn\u2019t in front of somebody\u2019s house. Most of the people that live on that street are reasonable people they\u2019re just trying to survive,\u201d Schwiebert added. A woman who lives in the neighborhood described to KOIN 6 that a solution to the homeless population in the city needs to go farther than one park. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the perception to the public is that it\u2019s Laurelhurst and not everywhere else, that it\u2019s a solution just for this neighborhood instead of a bigger solution for all of the homelessness in the city ,\u201d said resident Annette Shaff-Palmer. \u201cLents deserves a solution, Laurelhurst deserves a solution, downtown deserves a solution, it\u2019s not just this neighborhood.\u201d The mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for additional comment on the removal of the homeless camp and construction of the recreational courts. The number of homeless people in the Portland area has increased by about 50% since 2019, according to recent data. The mayor\u2019s office projected earlier this year that there are about 6,000 people living on the streets in the Portland region. The figure is considered an undercount, but is still markedly higher than the estimated 4,000 people who were homeless in 2019.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.153772354125977, 14.8790283203125]}, {"title": "WI judge orders Green Bay clerk to grant poll watchers greater access to in-person absentee voting", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wi-judge-orders-green-bay-clerk-grant-poll-watchers-greater-access-person-absentee-voting", "description": "A Green Bay clerk was ordered to give poll watchers greater access to in-person absentee voting by a Wisconsin judge.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Wisconsin judge on Wednesday ordered a clerk in Green Bay to grant poll watchers greater access to in-person absentee voting, siding with Republicans who alleged the clerk was improperly allowing them to only view certain parts of process. Judge Marc A. Hammer ordered City Clerk Celestine Jeffreys to allow poll watchers access to areas where voters complete witness certification and return their ballots in the city hall building. His order came a day after the Republican National Committee filed the lawsuit in Brown County. Poll watchers, referred to as election observers in Wisconsin, are legally entitled to view all the public parts of the voting process from an area designated by an election official . There are no residency requirements to be a poll watcher in the state. WISCONSIN MAN WHO WORE HITLER COSTUME FOR HALLOWEEN FIRED FROM MADISON CHILDREN'S MUSEUM Jeffreys said Wednesday afternoon that her office has complied with the order. \"In response to a legal action brought by the RNC regarding rules of observation, the city has provided additional areas of observation,\" Jeffreys said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \"The modifications made will continue to preserve and protect the integrity of the in-person absentee voting process while protecting voter security and freedom.\" A judge in Wisconsin ordered a Green Bay clerk to grant poll watchers greater access to in-person absentee voting. WI MAN ACCUSED OF POSTING MARKED BALLOT ON FACEBOOK CHARGED WITH FELONY According to the complaint, Jeffreys had previously allowed observers to be in her office, where voters would check in, register to vote and receive their ballots. However, voters were then sent into the hallway outside her office \u2014 out of sight of the poll watchers \u2014 to mark their choices, certify their ballot with a witness and place it in a ballot box.

According to the lawsuit, Primo exposed himself to Dr. Hillary Cauthen a total of nine times. The first incident allegedly occurred during a psychological session with Primo in December 2021 and was reported to Spurs management in January 2022. \"Rather than act on Dr. Cauthen's reports, the Spurs ignored her complaints, hoping the organization could ignore and then cover up Primo's actions,\" the lawsuit filed in Bexar County, Texas, states. \"The Spurs organization was willing to sacrifice Dr. Cauthen to keep what they hoped would one day be a star player. \"Once Primo's conduct entered the public sphere, the Spurs were forced to act and release Primo. The Spurs' recent actions with regard to Primo are too little, too late. The Spurs' public statement about Primo's departure is a complete farce. The Spurs' conduct sends a strong message that they, like other major sports organizations, are willing to tolerate abhorrent conduct on the part of athletes and sacrifice loyal employees, so long as the athlete is successful on the court.\" The attorney for Primo, William J. Briggs, denied the allegations in a statement. \"In an act of betrayal against her young client, Dr. Cauthen, who is 40 years old, falsely claims Josh Primo exposed himself to her during the course of her numerous therapy sessions,\" Briggs' statement said. \"Dr. Cauthen's allegations are either a complete fabrication, a gross embellishment or utter fantasy. Josh Primo never intentionally exposed himself to her or anyone else and was not even aware that his private parts were visible outside of his workout shorts. \"What makes the allegations even less credible is that Dr. Cauthen never informed her patient of the purported exposure. Dr. Cauthen was Mr. Primo's mental health support provider and confidant; a therapist who Mr. Primo trusted. She is much older than Mr. Primo, with many years of experience as a sports psychologist. It is baffling why she did not bother to tell her patient that his private parts were visible underneath his shorts.\" Cauthen's attorney, Tony Buzbee, said Cauthen intends to file a criminal complaint against Primo. Primo, the No. 12 pick in the 2021 draft, was released Friday, less than three weeks after the Spurs exercised his third-year team option guaranteeing a $4.3 million salary for the 2023-24 season. Spurs CEO RC Buford cited the \"best interest of both the organization and Joshua\" in a statement from the team announcing his release. According to Buzbee, Primo was waived just days after he allegedly exposed himself to another woman during the Spurs' trip to Minnesota last week, when Primo was held out of San Antonio's loss. Buzbee said that Primo also allegedly committed indecent exposure in Las Vegas in July while there for the NBA's summer league. \"Josh Primo's conduct is well outside of the bounds of what is normal and acceptable,\" Buzbee said in a Thursday morning news conference at his office in Houston. \"His conduct shocks the conscience. I would also say that the Spurs' conduct, the way they handled this conduct, was egregious and absolutely unreasonable.\" Buzbee, who also represents the women who have alleged sexual assault and inappropriate sexual misconduct by suspended Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson, said that there will be a criminal complaint with multiple counts of indecent exposure filed against Primo in Bexar County and that Cauthen would cooperate with authorities within the bounds of laws regarding confidentiality between a patient and psychologist. Cauthen was hired by the Spurs in April 2021. Her employment with the organization ended when her contract was not renewed in August 2022. Buzbee specifically cited Spurs general manager Brian Wright, as well as the team's general counsel, deputy general counsel and head of human relations, for failing to appropriately respond when Cauthen informed them of Primo's conduct. Buzbee said that Cauthen was told in June that coach Gregg Popovich was aware of the issue, but Buzbee added, \"We may have concluded here that they were lying.\" Buzbee said that instead of addressing the problem with Primo, Spurs management told Cauthen \"to sit it out,\" telling her that she could work from home and that the team had \"lost trust in her.\" \"The right thing is saying, 'No, this is not OK,' to hold people accountable, to make systemic change and to protect those that suffer in silence,\" Cauthen said at the news conference. \"The right thing is also saying, 'I'm sorry. I have failed you, and we need to do better.' \"The organization I worked for has failed me. ... I spoke up. I asked for help. I gave options. My voice and my feelings, my actionable items, were silenced. Due to their inaction and protection of their assets, other individuals were impacted, and for that I am truly sorry.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-14.03394889831543, -4.161274433135986]}, {"title": "This Shopify side hustle could make you $50K before the holidays", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/shopify-side-hustle-could-make-you-50k-before-the-holidays/", "description": "This Yuletide side hustle will reportedly make Christmas come early for one's wallet.", "content": "This Yuletide side hustle will reportedly make Christmas come early for one\u2019s wallet. Tired of blowing through money during the holiday season? Not to fear, an enterprising TikToker has reportedly discovered an ingenious way to make $50,000 between now and Christmas \u2014 by reselling items on Shopify, as seen in this TikTok clip with over 45,000 views. \u201cHere\u2019s how to make $50,000 before Christmas,\u201d teased life hack coach Alice Liu, who reportedly became a six-figure entrepreneur as a 20-year-old college student via various side hustles. She now regularly posts alleged money-making shortcuts to her over 540,000 TikTok followers. This latest hack banks on the fact that \u201ctons of people are looking for gifts to buy their\u201d significant others, opening the door for online entrepreneurs to \u201csell these romantic and cute items.\u201d \u201cThe catch is you have to start now,\u201d the serial side hustler explained.

Take advantage of this holiday shopping szn right now\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf84 #makemoneyonline #xmas #wifimoney #howtodropship #sidehustles To cash in on Christmas\u2019 giving spirit, per the clip, start by going to the website AutoDS.com , a tool that claims to have assisted in more than $200 million in sales annually. They specialize in \u201cdropshipping,\u201d an \u201corder fulfillment method where a business doesn\u2019t keep the products it sells in stock,\u201d per e-commerce site Shopify.com. \u201cInstead, the seller purchases inventory as needed from a third party\u2014usually a wholesaler or manufacturer\u2014to fulfill orders,\u201d they write. \u201cThe biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail model is that the selling merchant doesn\u2019t stock or own inventory\u2014they act as the middleman.\u201d For just $1, prospective hawkers can sign up for the AutoDS two-week trial, whereupon they should start adding products to their Shopify store as soon as possible. Ideal items \u2014 which can be found by searching #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt , per Liu \u2014 sell for around three times what they bought them for. For example, Liu bought \u201cEnchanted Galaxy Rose\u201d for $19, which she then resold for $59 on Shopify. This can result in major windfalls if items are bought in bulk. \u201cIf you sell over 5,000 of these items, you can easily profit over $50,000 before Christmas,\u201d said Liu. Sellers can enhance their sales by advertising the items on TikTok, making sure to appeal to audiences in a particular niche \u2014 similar to how Liu markets side hustles on her platform. She also recommends \u201crunning ads\u201d and even \u201cretargeting people through email/SMSmarketing.\u201d As with all get-rich-quick schemes, there are a few caveats. For one, users have to pay a monthly fee to use the service, entailing $29 for basic, $79 for Shopify and $299 for advanced. They also charge a fee of between 2% and 3% per transaction for each product sold depending on the plan. Despite the hurdles, Liu advises followers not to shy away from the Shopify side hustle. \u201cNinety-nine percent of people only consume content and don\u2019t take action, so make sure you take action if you\u2019re the 1 percent,\u201d the influencer urged. Finding a lucrative side hustle has been essential for many in light of the current inflation crisis, which saw consumer prices jump by a wallet-sapping 8.2% year-over-year last month.

Kay Nietfeld / DPA / Picture Alliance via Getty Images hide caption German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrives at Berlin-Brandenburg Airport for his flight to China on Thursday. HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 One of Europe's largest ports, Hamburg has excelled at trade since the Middle Ages. Back then, the city clubbed together with other ports along and beyond the Baltic coast to form the Hanseatic League, which dominated commerce for centuries. Now the city's port is joining forces with a Chinese shipping giant. The state-owned China Ocean Shipping Co., known as COSCO, is about to buy a stake in a container terminal. China has been Germany's largest trading partner for much of the past decade. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pushed the COSCO deal through his cabinet last week, despite opposition from six key ministers. The chancellor tried to address their concerns about selling off critical infrastructure by reducing COSCO's stake from 35% to 24.9%. And while his cabinet reluctantly agreed to this slimmed-down deal, it remains unpopular. Speaking on background, a senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday that the U.S. had also strongly suggested that China not be permitted to get a controlling stake in the Hamburg port terminal. While the deal is yet to be finalized, the timing of Scholz's cabinet approval of it has raised eyebrows in Berlin and other Western capitals. As Scholz heads to China to meet with President Xi Jinping on Friday, he is under political pressure at home, and from Washington, to rethink Berlin's relationship with Beijing. Scholz will be the first leader to visit China since Xi consolidated his power at last month's Chinese Communist Party Congress . Lawmakers \u2014 both from his own government and the opposition \u2014 are afraid of making the same mistakes with Beijing that they made with Moscow, where they were overly dependent on an autocratic state for their economic well-being. They are anxious to reduce Germany's economic dependency on China. But like Angela Merkel before him, Scholz is traveling to Beijing with a delegation of German CEOs, who are looking to continue business as usual. Noah Barkin, who researches European-Chinese relations for the think tank Rhodium Group , says the COSCO-Hamburg deal implies Scholz is not listening to his own government. \"The optics are not great,\" Barkin says. \"It appears that Scholz, shortly before heading to Beijing, is offering the Chinese government a gift.\" Barkin says the COSCO deal undermines previous policy pledges.

Axel Heimken / AFP / Getty Images hide caption Small boats pass in front of a COSCO Shipping Corporation container ship as it is unloaded at the Port of Hamburg on Oct. 26. \"Scholz's government came in promising a new, tougher stance\" on China, he says. \"They're putting the finishing touches on a new China strategy which will focus on diversification away from China. And Scholz is sending signals in the opposite direction. So there are big questions abroad about where Germany really stands on China.\" In response to the widespread criticism and head-scratching, Scholz laid out his intentions in Beijing in an op-ed for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Politico on Thursday. He writes that if China continues to become more authoritarian, Germany's policy toward it will change. He also warns that if Beijing \"tightens international production chains' dependence on China,\" Berlin will \"dismantle one-sided dependencies\" where needed. German manufacturers are already sourcing \"important raw materials, some rare earths or certain cutting-edge technologies\" from other partners, he writes. Scholz is also under pressure from Washington, which wants Germany to get out of China. Scholz asserts in his op-ed that \"calls by some to isolate China\" are not justified and that Berlin is not seeking to decouple from Beijing. Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Economic Research Institute, says Washington isn't the only capital that sees heavy German investment in China as a problem. Brussels and Paris are unhappy with it as well. \"Our neighbors have accused Germany of pursuing a very mercantilist approach with the short term economic gain being top priority,\" Fratzscher says. \"And I think that is a fair criticism.\" Germany's Foreign Ministry, under Annalena Baerbock, continues to oppose the COSCO deal. While all three coalition parties agreed to pen a new China policy \u2014 due to be adopted in 2023 \u2014 Baerbock's Green party is the most outspoken when it comes to China and human rights abuses. Speaking to public broadcaster ARD this week, Baerbock argued, \"It's vital that we never again make ourselves so existentially dependent on a country that doesn't share our values.\" But with a recession looming, German industry has no intention of upsetting its largest market, let alone cutting ties. One of the business leaders accompanying Scholz to Beijing is from chemicals giant BASF, which is shifting production from Germany to China because of the spike in energy costs in Europe. Another executive is from Volkswagen, which sells almost 40% of its cars to China. Hildegard M\u00fcller, president of Germany's automotive industry lobby warns that decoupling from China would be \"a grave economic and geostrategic mistake.\" Barkin says German companies should rebalance their global footprints rather than doubling down on China. \"There is a risk of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait,\" Barkin says. \"If that were to happen, German firms with a heavy presence in China would be incredibly vulnerable.\" Back in Hamburg, retired businessman J\u00f6rg Hellmund waits to board a harbor ferry. He's uneasy about COSCO buying into the port. \"Letting China invest in the port here is the last thing we should be doing considering the state of the world right now,\" Hellmund says. \"Sure, Scholz is trying to keep both German industry and Beijing happy, but he has to strike a balance.\" Unlike the profitable Hanseatic trading partnerships of the past, Hellmund doubts there's anything mutually beneficial about this alliance.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "business", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [12.777020454406738, -2.854334592819214]}, {"title": "Prosecutors rest in Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy trial of Oath Keepers members", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1133930606/prosecutors-rest-jan-6-seditious-conspiracy-trial-oath-keepers", "description": "The defendants are Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and four other members of the far right group.", "content": "Stewart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, speaking outside the White House in 2017.

Susan Walsh/AP hide caption Stewart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, speaking outside the White House in 2017. He and four other group members are on trial on charges that include seditious conspiracy, related to the attack on the Capitol. After a month of testimony, the government rested its case Thursday in the seditious conspiracy trial against Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and four other members of the far-right group. The trial is the most consequential yet to emerge from the Justice Department's sprawling investigation into the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Rhodes and the other defendants are accused of plotting to use force to prevent Joe Biden from taking office as president. The jury heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including FBI special agents, U.S. Capitol Police officers, former Oath Keepers, as well as two members of the group who stormed the Capitol and later pleaded guilty to conspiracy. Jurors also were shown reams of Signal chats, Facebook messages and other communications the defendants sent, as well as videos and audio recordings that show what the defendants were saying and doing in the lead-up to Jan. 6, on the day itself and then afterwards. Rhodes and his alleged co-conspirators \u2014 Jessica Watkins, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell \u2014 are charged with seditious conspiracy, obstruction and other offenses in connection with Jan. 6. Watkins, Meggs and Harrelson donned tactical gear and forced their way up the Capitol steps that day and into the building. Rhodes and Caldwell were on Capitol grounds, but did not enter the complex. As part of the alleged plot, prosecutors presented evidence that the Oath Keepers stashed guns at a hotel in Virginia just outside Washington, D.C., for a quick reaction force to speed into the city on Jan. 6, if necessary. Prosecutors say the conspiracy didn't end on Jan. 6, but instead continued through Biden's inauguration. The government used one of its last witnesses to introduce critical evidence on that front. Prosecutors called Jason Alpers, a military veteran who now does software development in Texas, testified Wednesday that a few days after the Capitol attack he met Rhodes and a few other Oath Keepers in the parking lot of an electronics store in the Dallas area. Rhodes wanted to get a message to then-President Donald Trump, which was something Alpers said he would be able to do \"indirectly.\" Alpers testified that he secretly recorded the meeting because he wanted to be sure to have an accurate record of what was said to pass along to the president. Alpers said that during the meeting Rhodes typed out on Alpers' cellphone a message for Trump, in which Rhodes urged Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to remain in power. \"If you don't, then Biden/Kamala will turn all that power on you, your family, and all of us. You and your family will be imprisoned and killed,\" Rhodes wrote in the message, which was shown to the jury. \"And us veterans will die in combat on US soil, fighting against traitors who YOU turned over all the powers of the Presidency to.\" Rhodes urges Trump to be the \"savior of the Republic, not a man who surrendered it to deadly traitors and enemies, who then enslaved and murdered millions of Americans.\" Prosecutors also played clips of the recording Alpers made of the meeting. In one snippet, Rhodes can be heard saying: \"If he's not going to do the right thing, and he's just gonna let himself be removed illegally, then we should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang f****** Pelosi from the lamppost.\" On the stand, Alpers told jurors that he did not agree with what Rhodes saying or his message. \"Asking for civil war to be on American ground and understanding, being a person who's gone to war, that means blood is going to get shed on the streets where your family lives,\" Alpers testified. \"It was at that point that I stepped back and am questioning whether pushing this to President Trump is in the best interest.\" Ultimately, Alpers did not pass the message to Trump. Instead, he provided recording of the meeting as well as the note Rhodes wrote to the FBI. In their cross examination of government witnesses, defense attorneys were able to score some points. Under questioning, FBI agents testified that in the thousands of text messages the defendants sent they did not find any concrete plan \u2014 or order \u2014 to storm the Capitol. The two Oath Keeper cooperating witnesses also said there was no specific plan to do so, although they did testify that it was their understanding that they wanted to stop Congress on Jan. 6. They have suggested that all of the inflammatory talk in texts and messages was bombastic, but was largely just hot talk. Now that the government has rested, the defendants will have an opportunity to put on a case of their own.

The study will evaluate whether the shot is tolerable, as well as safer, for human patients or if it has the ability to produce a response by the immune system. One hundred-eighty human participants from the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 64 will be used in the study, \"The flexibility and manufacturing speed of the mRNA technology has demonstrated that it is well-suited for other respiratory diseases,\" said Pfizer's chief scientific officer Annaliesa Anderson in a statement. \"Pfizer is deeply proud of our continued work to explore its potential to protect against influenza and COVID-19 in one combination vaccine, which we think could simplify immunization practices against these two respiratory pathogens, potentially leading to better vaccine uptake for both diseases.\" COVID-19 SYMPTOMS REBOUND AFTER PAXLOVID MAY BE DUE TO IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE Pfizer is working with BioNTech to develop a combination vaccine capable of protecting against influenza and COVID-19.

This is an exciting step in our ongoing journey with BioNTech as we collectively look to transform the prevention of infectious diseases around the world,\" Anderson added. The first participant to receive the dose was given the combined vaccine earlier this week. Meanwhile, competitor drugmaker Moderna Inc. is working with Novavax to also create a vaccine capable of fighting both COVID-19 and influenza. Although the U.S. COVID-19 rate is declining, companies are still looking to develop different protections against variants of the infectious disease.

The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy\u2019s health, followed on the heels of news this week of an unexpected jump in job openings in September . Labor market resilience gives the Fed cover to continue tightening monetary policy, and also keeps the economy growing for now. \u201cThere is still no indication that layoffs are picking up in any meaningful way,\u201d said Dante DeAntonio, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Penn. \u201cThe ongoing lack of layoffs will help propel consumer spending moving forward even as household balance sheets come under pressure from high inflation.\u201d Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Oct. 29. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications filed than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. Unadjusted claims rose 1,174 to 185,594 last week. They were lifted by a 2,535 jump in filings in California as a well as a increase of 1,566 in Oregon, which offset a 1,832 drop in Florida as the effects on Hurricane Ian faded. There was also a notable decline in claims in Kentucky. Claims bounced around in a tight 214,000 to 226,000 range in October. Though there has been an increase in layoffs in interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like finance, technology and housing, employers have generally been hoarding workers as labor remains scarce in some service industries. The central bank on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points and said its fight against inflation would require borrowing costs to rise further, but signaled it may be nearing an inflection point in what has become the swiftest tightening of US monetary policy in 40 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the labor market \u201cremains extremely tight,\u201d and \u201ccontinues to be out of balance.\u201d There were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person at the end of September, which is boosting wage growth. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, rose 47,000 to 1.485 million in the week ending Oct. 22. The data has no bearing on October\u2019s employment report, scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200,000 jobs in October. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September. Domestic demand barely grew in the third quarter even as gross domestic product rebounded after contracting in the first half of the year, largely driven by a shrinking trade deficit. Though unemployment rolls remain small, there has been an uptick in layoffs. A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday showed job cuts announced by US-based employers increased 13% to 33,843 in October, the highest since February 2021. There was a jump in planned layoffs in construction, technology, industrial goods and warehousing industries. \u201cWe are beginning to see more job cut activity in the fourth quarter, historically when the bulk of cuts occur, as companies finalize budgets and plans,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Still, announced layoffs so far this year are down 16% to 243,338, the lowest January-October total since Challenger began tracking the series in 1993.

Andrew Cuomo and other Democratic leaders if the GOP retakes the House in next week\u2019s midterm elections. The existence of the CDC reports to state officials was described in a briefing last year for members of the House Ways and Means Committee and date from May 2020, the approximate end date of New York requiring nursing homes to take COVID-19 patients. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the retiring ranking member of the committee, renewed a request for the records in a Thursday letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. It was co-signed by committee members Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.). The lawmakers said the records could provide insight into the cover-up of death data by Cuomo and his administration. \u201cDuring [a] March 11, 2021, briefing, we learned that the [CDC] used the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) to gather COVID-19 related nursing home data directly from nursing homes across the country,\u201d Brady writes. \u201cAs part of that data collection effort, which began in May 2020, the CDC provided monthly reports to state governments summarizing the data reported directly by nursing homes.\u201d The letter adds, \u201cwe remain concerned about the policy decisions in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding nursing homes and whether certain states may have intentionally misled the public and perhaps the federal government regarding COVID-19-related deaths in those facilities.\u201d Cuomo on March 25, 2020, barred nursing homes from turning away patients \u201csolely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19,\u201d which the families of victims say caused the deaths of thousands of elderly residents. Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa later confessed to Democratic state legislators that the administration decided to conceal nursing home death statistics because \u201cwe froze\u201d out of fear that the data would \u201cbe used against us\u201d by federal prosecutors. Republicans including upstate Rep. Elise Stefanik are vowing to resurrect House oversight efforts if they reclaim the power to subpoena documents and testimony. Cuomo\u2019s order was intended to ease hospital crowding. But critics say it caused mass death while federal treatment facilities such as a military hospital ship and a temporary hospital in the Javits Center were closed due to too few patients . The Brady-led letter seeks CDC reports pertaining to New York and four other states with similar orders \u2014 California, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \u201cThe American people deserve a government that is accountable, which is especially critical when decisions are made that may have resulted in additional transmission of the COVID-19 virus and the loss of thousands of American lives,\u201d the letter says. \u201cTherefore, we request that [HHS] preserve all documents and communications in its custody related to COVID-19-related nursing home data collection through NHSN and about whether certain states may have intentionally misled the public and perhaps the federal government regarding COVID-19-related deaths in those facilities.\u201d HHS did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment. Cuomo has denied that his order caused excess deaths and accused critics of trying to exploit the tragic toll for political gain. The nursing home storyline has lingering significance in New York politics. Stefanik recently accused Cuomo\u2019s successor and former lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the nursing home deaths.

Federal investigations apparently were discontinued after President Biden took office. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said last year there were about 50% more nursing home patient deaths than reported by Cuomo\u2019s administration. Her report indicated almost one-third of New York\u2019s more than 43,000 COVID-19 deaths at the time were linked to nursing homes. More than 13,000 New York nursing home patients may have died from the virus, according to James. The official state count acknowledged 8,711 deaths at the time. Before James released her findings, an Associated Press analysis in August 2020 found 11,000 New York nursing home residents may have died. A book released in August by former Trump White House adviser Jared Kushner said that Cuomo specifically mentioned his concern about nursing home safety 10 days before ordering the facilities to take sick patients.

The Independent Resolution Panel (IRP) announced Thursday that Louisville avoided a postseason ban and other significant sanctions in the infractions case that began with the FBI's 2017 investigation into corruption around college basketball and the school's relationship with former star recruit Brian Bowen Jr. Louisville was also given a two-week ban on unofficial visits and a public reprimand and censure. The panel concluded that the NCAA failed to show \"evidence\" that Adidas, cited as an orchestrator of a scheme to funnel recruits to its partner schools, \"was a representative\" of the university. Former Louisville assistants Kenny Johnson and Jordan Fair, who had been accused by the NCAA of arranging payments to Bowen's family and the family of another recruit and providing false information to the NCAA about their relationships with recruits, were both given two-year show-cause penalties by the panel for Level I violations. Those penalties will limit their collective ability to work in college basketball during that period. Johnson is an assistant at Rhode Island on Archie Miller's staff, while Fair has recently coached on the AAU circuit. The panel's ruling cannot be appealed. In 2017, the FBI alleged that Pitino and his staff had worked with Adidas, the school's apparel partner, to funnel payments to Bowen and another recruit. Both Pitino, now the head coach at Iona, and former athletic director Tom Jurich were fired. The NCAA's notice of allegations cited Pitino for failure to promote an atmosphere of compliance. Multiple people tied to Adidas have been indicted and imprisoned for their roles in the corruption scandal, but the panel determined that both Pitino and Adidas were not at fault. \"As a result, the hearing panel did not find any additional violations for Louisville related to actions by the apparel company or its employees in this case,\" the panel said in a statement. \"Additionally, the hearing panel determined no violation by [Pitino] occurred given that he demonstrated he promoted an atmosphere of compliance.\" That ruling also could bode well for Kansas, which faces similar accusations of using Adidas to influence recruits in an infractions case also being handled by the IRP. Kansas announced Wednesday that it had self-imposed a four-game suspension on coach Bill Self and assistant Kurtis Townsend, who are both named in the notice of allegations against the school. While Louisville was working through the Bowen case, allegations of recruiting violations against Mack, who left the program last year, complicated and extended this chapter for Louisville. After former assistant Dino Gaudio threatened to expose NCAA allegations within the Louisville program following his dismissal from Mack's staff, he was charged in federal court for an attempt to extort the program. He received a fine and probation. Louisville later self-reported multiple recruiting violations related to graduate managers and other staffers participating in on-court activities and showing videos to recruits that featured their names, images and likenesses. But the IRP determined those violations were \"isolated and inadvertent and provided no more than a minimal recruiting or competitive advantage and, thus, did not provide sufficient basis to support that [Mack] violated head coach responsibility or failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-17.459762573242188, -6.467136859893799]}, {"title": "How Aaron Rodgers is handling the Packers\u2019 trade deadline inaction", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/aaron-rodgers-trusts-packers-gm-after-trade-deadline-inaction/", "description": "Aaron Rodgers resisted any urge to throw his general manager under the bus.", "content": "The Packers stood pat at the 2022 NFL trade deadline , despite scuffling to a 3-5 start with a lack of weapons for quarterback Aaron Rodgers. In his first comments since the deadline, the 38-year-old resisted any urge to throw general manager Brian Gutekunst under the bus. \u201cThe compensation for whatever players we were going after just didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Rodgers said, according to USA Today . \u201cSo I trust Brian, and we had some good conversations. We were in on some things. It just didn\u2019t pan out.\u201d The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that the Packers made an offer to the Steelers for wide receiver Chase Claypool, who ended up being dealt to the division-rival Bears . Green Bay offered a second-round pick, which was what the Bears ended up giving Pittsburgh \u2013 though Chicago\u2019s pick will likely be higher, which is why that deal got done. Broncos reporter Benjamin Allbright also reported that the Packers checked in on receiver Jerry Jeudy, whom Denver had reportedly dangled in trade talks. However, they \u201cdidn\u2019t get close\u201d to the asking price, which was reportedly a second-rounder as well as another mid-round pick. The Packers now have no choice but to go forward with their current wide receiver group, which consists of Allen Lazard, rookies Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson, Randall Cobb (currently on IR) and Sammy Watkins. Lazard is their leading receiver despite only playing six games, with 340 yards. Second is Doubs with 296, and third is tight end Robert Tonyan (286 yards.) The formula has not been a winning one for Green Bay, which has lost four straight games to the Giants, Jets, Commanders and Bills. Rodgers is averaging 216 passing yards per game in the losing streak and the team is averaging 17.5 points per game. Gutekunst has faced criticism over the way he has handled the offense around Rodgers in recent years. In 2020, the team traded up in the first round to select quarterback Jordan Love, who has only started one game and appears unlikely to see the field at all until Rodgers is gone \u2013 which may not happen before his rookie contract expires. In 2021, the Packers took cornerback Eric Stokes in the first round, and with their two first-rounders in 2022, they selected two more defensive players \u2013 Quay Walker and Devonte Wyatt, both out of Georgia. Perhaps most notably, Gutekunst traded away Rodgers\u2019 most-trusted weapon in Davante Adams, sending the receiver to the Raiders for a haul of draft picks. To replace him, the team signed Watkins and drafted Watson and Doubs in the second and fourth rounds, respectively. Watson has barely seen the field due to injuries, and Doubs has struggled with drops. Rodgers has openly criticized the young receivers , saying on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d that \u201cguys who are making too many mistakes shouldn\u2019t be playing.\u201d And despite their investments in the defense, the entire unit has underperformed \u2013 especially against the run. Green Bay has given up the fourth-most rushing yards per game through eight weeks, and their overall defense ranks 22nd in Football Outsiders\u2019 DVOA statistic.

Paul Sancya/AP hide caption Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, is warning owners of 276,000 older vehicles to stop driving them after Takata air bags apparently exploded, killing three more people. DETROIT \u2014 Stellantis and the U.S. government are warning owners of 276,000 older vehicles to stop driving them after Takata air bags apparently exploded in three more vehicles, killing the drivers. The company, formerly Fiat Chrysler, is telling people to stop driving Dodge Magnum wagons, Dodge Challenger and Charger muscle cars and Chrysler 300 sedans from the 2005 through 2010 model years. Stellantis says it confirmed the driver's air bag inflators blew apart in two cases, killing two drivers. The company suspects an inflator rupture in another case that also killed a driver. All three deaths were in warm-weather U.S. states and happened in the past seven months in 2010 model year vehicles, the company said. The fatalities bring the death toll from exploding Takata air bags to at least 32 worldwide, including 23 in the United States. Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can become more volatile over time when exposed to moisture in the air and repeated high temperatures. The explosion can blow apart a metal canister and hurl shrapnel into the passenger compartment. Most of the deaths and about 400 injuries have happened in U.S. states with warmer weather. The Stellantis vehicles under the \"Do Not Drive\" warning were all recalled in 2015, and free repairs were available since then. Stellantis said it made numerous attempts to reach owners but the repairs were not made. The recalls affect vehicles in which the air bag inflators have not been replaced as part of the recall. \"Left unrepaired, recalled Takata air bags are increasingly dangerous as the risk of an explosion rises as vehicles age,\" Ann Carlson, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a statement. \"Every day that passes when you don't get a recalled air bag replaced puts you and your family at greater risk of injury or death.\" On Thursday, NHTSA urged all owners to check to see if their vehicles have an unrepaired Takata air bag recall. Drivers can go to https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and key in their 17-digit vehicle identification number to see if they have any open recalls. Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that millions have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata Corp. of Japan into bankruptcy. Most of the deaths have been in the U.S., but they also have occurred in Australia and Malaysia.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "business", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [3.36498761177063, 16.905454635620117]}, {"title": "\u2018Thursday Night Football\u2019 Live Stream: Channel, Eagles-Texans \u2018TNF\u2019 Streaming Info", "link": "https://decider.com/2022/11/03/thursday-night-football-channel-live-stream-eagles-texans-how-to-watch-tnf-amazon/", "description": "The Eagles look to remain undefeated as they battle the Texans on Thursday Night Football.", "content": "Week 9 of the NFL season officially begins as the Houston Texans host the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday Night Football !

While his vocation might sound immoral, Andrew claims that he doesn\u2019t have any regrets about putting people out of pocket. \u201cI do not believe in karma,\u201d declared the proud huckster of his \u201cexciting\u201d way of earning a living. \u201cSometimes I feel bad but often I do not.\u201d Part of Andrew\u2019s lack of remorse likely stems from the fact that he\u2019s never been caught. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any problems with [the government], so I\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d said the flippant fraudster, adding, \u201cAnd right now I\u2019m living in Canada, and I\u2019m scamming people in Russia, so how could it affect me?\u201d He added that ultimately \u201cI do what I do to survive.\u201d Despite tooting his own horn-swoggle, Andrew says sometimes he doesn\u2019t feel \u201cproud\u201d of his unethical breadwinning method, and eventually plans to start up his own online \u201clegal business.\u201d In fact, by bragging about his scams, the grifter inadvertently helped warn people about what red flags to look out for. At one point, Jordan asked the young huckster \u201cHow would you get me to go to the [online] casino?\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of different phrases that we use to grab the people\u2019s attention, all the stuff about the easy money, no work, do your own business, follow the trends, don\u2019t lose your opportunities,\u201d Andrew replied. Unfortunately, he predicts that \u201conline scamming will get a lot bigger with a recession.\u201d Indeed, during the 2009 economic downturn, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Internet Crime Complaints Center fielded 336,655 online crime complaints, marking a 22.3% uptick from the year prior, per the Street. This might not bode well given the current inflation crisis, which saw consumer prices jump by a wallet-sapping 8.2% year-over-year last month.

Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said Allen, a dad of one and a CVS technician, was allegedly drunk, and his wife took him to a hospital for a medical evaluation.

The short-form video app, which emerged as a destination for dance videos from influencers like Charli D\u2019Amelio and has warped into one of the biggest social platforms of today, will play a significant role in Hercules , according to a Variety cover story on the Russo Brothers. Joe told Variety their Hercules , which will be directed by Guy Ritchie, will be \u201ca little bit more experimental in tone, a little bit more experimental in execution,\u201d than previous live-action Disney films. While Hercules will get a shake-up from the Russo Brothers, they\u2019re still keeping the musical element from the 1997 animated film, but infusing it with that TikTok magic. As Joe explained, \u201cThere are questions about how you translate it as a musical. Audiences today have been trained by TikTok, right?

That can be a lot of fun and help us push the boundaries a little bit on how you execute a modern musical.\u201d Well, he may think it\u2019s fun, but Twitter doesn\u2019t exactly agree.

BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Under former President Donald Trump, the United States pushed hard for regime change in Venezuela. In response to a crackdown on democracy by Venezuela's authoritarian leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Washington in 2019 placed sanctions on the country's vital oil sector. Along with more than 50 countries, the U.S. recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's rightful president. And it encouraged the Venezuelan military to topple Maduro. But none of this has worked. The military continues to back Maduro, who has kept Venezuela's economy (barely) afloat by selling oil to China and other allies. Support for Guaid\u00f3, who wields no real power, is waning with more countries reengaging with Maduro. Now, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ban on Russian oil imports is prompting the U.S. to seek new sources of energy. For all these reasons, the Biden administration is extending a tentative olive branch to Venezuela. The Biden administration has sent delegations to Caracas where the two sides negotiated a prisoner swap that freed seven Americans, including five oil executives. They also discussed easing U.S. sanctions, a move that could help U.S.-based Chevron expand its oil operations in Venezuela. But before that can happen, the U.S. wants the Maduro regime to return to stalled negotiations in Mexico with Venezuela's political opposition. Its leaders are demanding democratic reforms that would open the door to free and fair Venezuelan presidential elections in 2024. \"We would like the release of political prisoners,\" Carlos Vecchio, the Venezuelan opposition's envoy to Washington, told NPR, speaking about his countrymen jailed in Venezuela. \"We would like to see a date for the election. We would like to see free media and protection against human rights violations.\" Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro speaks during a news conference in Caracas Tuesday. His government has met with U.S. officials and this week, the Colombian president, in signs countries may be warming up to the authoritarian Venezuelan regime. Andrea Hernandez Briceno / Bloomberg / Getty Images hide caption Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro speaks during a news conference in Caracas Tuesday. His government has met with U.S. officials and this week, the Colombian president, in signs countries may be warming up to the authoritarian Venezuelan regime. Sanctions relief would help Venezuela rebuild its oil industry and allow its crude to start flowing to global markets again, including to the U.S., which used to be Venezuela's No. 1 buyer. Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves and used to produce nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day. That figure dropped to just 534,000 in October, according to Reuters. Jump-starting the oil sector would help revive Venezuela's moribund economy which \u2014 due to mostly to corruption and mismanagement \u2014 contracted by about two-thirds between 2014 and 2020. A growing economy, in turn, would boost Maduro should he run for president again in 2024. Maduro \"can use repression and fraud to stay in power. But I think he would far rather win a relatively clean election,\" said Phil Gunson, a senior analyst in Caracas for the International Crisis Group. \"And he can't do that unless the economy is fixed or at least looks like it's moving in the right direction.\" Reengagement could convince Maduro to return to negotiations with the political opposition with the goal of free elections and a democratic transition. Should that happen, a gradual lifting of sanctions could put more Venezuelan oil on the global market, a key goal amid the energy shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. reengagement could help blunt the growing influence of Russia and China in Venezuela. Sanctions relief could, in turn, help improve Venezuela's economy and reduce the outflow of Venezuelan migrants. Under Maduro, more than 7 million people have fled Venezuela with many bound for the United States . Meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro met Maduro in Caracas Tuesday and pledged to improve trade and security cooperation between the neighboring countries, in another sign of nations warming up to the regime.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.97906494140625, 0.01058476883918047]}, {"title": "UCL talking points: Bayern's ruthless run, group stage MVP and dark horse teams", "link": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/uefa-champions-league/story/4788740/champions-league-talking-points-bayern-munich-ruthless-group-stage-mvp-plus-dark-horse-teams?device=featurephone", "description": "With the Champions League group stage complete, our writers answer some of our burning questions ahead of the knockout stage.", "content": "The 2022-23 Champions League group stage is all wrapped up, and there was no shortage of drama, goals and chaos. Bayern Munich achieved a perfect record, Tottenham Hotspur narrowly clinched qualification into the knockouts and Club Brugge made it out of the group stage for the first time in their history. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid were embarrassed after finishing last in their group, Rangers ended with the worst record in a group stage, and Barcelona are back in the Europa League for the second consecutive season. Our writers James Olley, Julien Laurens and Alex Kirkland answer some of the big questions arising from this week's games. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.) What caught your attention from matchday six? Olley: Bayern Munich's remorseless group stage record. The Bundesliga giants this week became the first team to win all six group matches on three separate occasions. They've done it in the past four seasons, too, with an aggregate score of 64-10 -- and not against minnows either: Bayern have faced Barcelona (twice), Inter Milan, Tottenham and Benfica among others in that time. By contrast, a special mention for Rangers making a strong case as the worst team in Champions League group stage history, racking up the worst-ever goal difference (-20) of any team to lose all six matches. Laurens: Benfica's incredible win away at Maccabi Haifa to pip Paris Saint-Germain to top spot in the group. The Portuguese club have been one of the best teams of this round, but they started the night in second place with the same amount of points as PSG but +4 of goal difference against Paris' +8. At 1-1 at half-time in Israel, it didn't look like they could do it but they had an amazing second half to win 6-1, bridging the goal-difference gap and beating PSG on away goals scored. Benfica coach Roger Schmidt and his players celebrated in style on the pitch when it was confirmed that they had finished top, meaning they will avoid facing any of the other group winners in the draw for the round of 16. Kirkland: Celtic had nothing to play for at the Bernabeu on Wednesday -- they were already certain to finish bottom of Group F -- but that didn't stop 8,000 fans from traveling to Real Madrid to enjoy the occasion. Officially, just over 2,000 had tickets, but there were many more dotted around the stadium. Their noisy enthusiasm was only slightly dampened by going behind early to Luka Modric's sixth-minute penalty, as a ruthless Madrid scored five times -- the outstanding Fede Valverde contributing a long-range goal and an assist that was reminiscent of the one he provided in last season's Champions League final -- before Jota rewarded the away fans with a late free kick to see the game end 5-1. Which team is the dark horse in this year's knockout stages? Laurens: Eintracht Frankfurt are the surprise entrants in the round of 16, and it is an amazing story. They are the proper dark horses with nothing to lose. Everything is a bonus now for the 2022 Europa League winners. They have a great unit, amazing team spirit, are tactically hard to beat and have great talents like Randal Kolo Muani, Evan N'Dicka or Jesper Lindstrom, experienced players like Mario Gotze or Kevin Trapp. They play with intensity and could cause problems for many clubs with their quick attacking transitions. - Ogden: Shakhtar's Champions League dream is over, but their resilience makes them winners Kirkland: Does a team that's top of Serie A -- and topped Group A ahead of last season's beaten finalists Liverpool -- count as a dark horse? Luciano Spalletti's Napoli have won so many admirers already this season, and players such as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Giacomo Raspadori and Stanislav Lobotka are among the most fun to watch in Europe. Nobody will want to meet them in the round of 16. Otherwise, Porto looked good pulling off a remarkable turnaround in Group B, recovering from back-to-back losses in their first two games to win four in a row, scoring 11 goals and conceding just one. Olley: It may seem odd to describe AC Milan as \"dark horses\" given they have won the competition on seven occasions, but this is their first appearance in the knockout stages since 2014. They managed to finish second in a group containing Chelsea -- winners in 2021 -- despite battling a severe injury list for much of the group stage. Winger Rafael Leao is understandably attracting major interest from some of Europe's powerhouses, but they possess talent in abundance and Stefano Pioli's young group have room for further improvement as the tournament progresses. Atletico finished bottom of their group for the first time in their history. Is the Diego Simeone era coming to an end? Kirkland: Isn't it always? Midseason crises have become a regular event at Atletico. The team slump, Simeone comes under pressure, they bounce back to finish in the top four in LaLiga and qualify for the Champions League, and on it goes. But while they've had European disappointments before -- dropping out at the group stage in 2017 -- it's never been this bad. That year they won the Europa League. Now there's no European football at all. The rock-solid, supremely cynical Atletico that played two Champions League finals feels like ancient history. This latest version is fragile in defence and lacks clarity in attack. Building a winning team again might be Simeone's biggest test yet. Olley: Atletico are in the midst of an identity crisis, now exacerbated by exiting Europe in this humiliating fashion. A team founded on dogged, tireless defensive discipline shipped nine goals in the group stage and 12 so far in as many LaLiga games. Simeone has previously spoken about trying to make Atletico a more expansive team but they seem caught between what they were and what they want to be, a situation not aided by Joao Felix largely failing to live up to his price tag. It doesn't have to be the end of an era but Simeone either has to drive genuine evolution or return this Atletico team to the principles that enabled them to punch above their weight for so long. Laurens: The cycle has been over for a while. The league title two years ago was only due to the magic of Luis Suarez from the first half of the season and that of Jan Oblak in the second half of that campaign. Simeone's tactics are of another time and with the current squad he has at his disposal, it is a disgrace that they only won one game in a group featuring Brugge, Bayer Leverkusen and Porto. To finish bottom of the table and miss out on the Europa League place is humiliating, too. The end of the season would be the perfect time to start a new chapter and for the club to part ways with Simeone who is under contract until June 2024. But instead, they are talking about extending his deal. Who is your group stage MVP? Olley: Napoli have exceeded all expectations at home and abroad this season, and Kvaratskhelia is rapidly becoming one of Europe's hottest properties. The Serie A side reportedly paid just \u20ac10m to acquire the 21-year-old from Dinamo Batuni this summer but he has excelled on the Champions League stage, registering two goals and three assists from five appearances in a series of dynamic and exhilarating performances. Real Madrid, Liverpool and Chelsea are just three of the clubs tracking the Georgian winger ahead of a possible big-money move next summer. Laurens: Even if PSG finished second behind Benfica, Kylian Mbappe has been outstanding. He scored seven goals (his best record in a group stage) including some beauties like the first one against Juventus in Paris and he gave three assists as well. At 23 and 317 days, he became the youngest player ever to reach 40 goals in the competition, beating Lionel Messi's record. And despite all the agitation around him and his future in the last few weeks, he has been playing at a top level throughout this group stages. Kirkland: Forgive the lack of originality, but: Messi. Four goals, four assists and a blossoming, deadly partnership with Mbappe. Messi is back to playing some of the best football of his career, and now looks settled and entirely comfortable at Paris Saint-Germain.

With the year he had left on his deal, Chubb is now contractually tied to the Dolphins for six years and $119 million. Dolphins GM Chris Grier, vice president Brandon Shore and Chubb's agent Erik Burkhardt of Roc Nation Sports did the deal in the past two days, per sources. The Broncos traded Chubb to the Dolphins on Tuesday for a package that included the 2023 first-round pick that Miami acquired from the San Francisco 49ers last year. The Dolphins also sent running back Chase Edmonds and a 2024 fourth-round pick to Denver for a 2025 fifth-round selection. Chubb, 26, was in the final year of the rookie contract he signed in 2018, but Grier made it clear Wednesday that Miami did not part ways with a first-round pick for a one-year rental. \"When you do a deal like that for a player, you always would like to -- from our perspective when we do business -- we would like to have something done, and we anticipate having something finished up here shortly,\" he said Wednesday. The past Pro Bowler has recorded 5.5 sacks this season and ranks third in the NFL with a 25.8% pass rush win rate; his new teammate, Jaelan Phillips, ranks fourth. Chubb's career has been marred by injuries over the past three seasons. He has missed 24 out of 49 possible games entering 2022, mainly because of a torn ACL and a bone spur in his ankle. Grier said the Dolphins did extensive research into his injury history and work ethic and determined there was no major cause for concern. Over the next two seasons, the Dolphins will have to make decisions on several key players, such as Christian Wilkins, Andrew Van Ginkel, Nik Needham and Tua Tagovailoa, while also issuing $17 million or more to four players not including Chubb -- Tyreek Hill, Terron Armstead, Byron Jones and Emmanuel Ogbah.

Republicans on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, in a letter to board chairman Anthony Coscia sent Wednesday, said the extravagant rewards \u2013\u201cpaid largely from taxpayer funds\u201d \u2014 were an affront to everyday Amtrak employees. \u201cPayment of lavish executive bonuses when Amtrak services and revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels, and financial losses appear permanent, seem inappropriate, wasteful, and disrespectful to Amtrak\u2019s nonexecutive, front-line employees and taxpayers,\u201d states the letter. Republican Reps. Republicans Rick Crawford of Arkansas and Sam Graves of Missouri, who signed the letter, noted the bonuses were doled out at a time of turmoil at the rail line, which they said had adjusted operating earnings of negative $789 million in 2020 and negative $1.03 billion in 2021. They requested the board provide them with answers to five questions, including the metrics on which performance bonuses are based; how those compare with similar firms heavily financed by the federal government; and the board\u2019s role in determining bonuses. \u201cGiven Amtrak\u2019s struggles are expected to continue indefinitely, we remain concerned about plans for awarding executive bonuses when the company expects billions of dollars in annual future losses,\u201d the congressmen wrote. The letter came weeks after a Post report that showed the top-10 Amtrak earners in 2021 raked in six-figure bonuses that, in one instance, nearly doubled a top executive\u2019s annual salary. The New York Times first reported on the extravagant compensation packages. Data received by The Post through a Freedom of Information Act request showed the 10 top-earners at the rail line padded out their \u201cgross income\u201d in the year 2021 with eye-popping \u201cearned incentive\u201d bonuses. According to the figures, William Herrmann, the rail line\u2019s vice president senior managing deputy general counsel, appears to have cashed in the largest earned incentive bonus in 2021. Herrmann had a base salary of $352,898, but raked in a whopping $653,879.74, according to the figures. His additional pay of more than $300,000 represents about 85% of his base salary. In a statement at the time, an Amtrak spokesperson said earned incentive bonuses are common in the transportation industry and are widely used in the private sector, where executives are compensated at a higher rate. \u201cTo earn incentives, Amtrak must achieve a high level of corporate performance in support of our company\u2019s strategic plan \u2013 and employees must also meet their individual performance goals,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [19.490890502929688, -1.1951053142547607]}, {"title": "Tropicana debuts \u2018perfect\u2019 mimosa maker with orange juice spray bottle", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/tropicana-debuts-perfect-mimosa-maker-with-orange-juice-spray-bottle/", "description": "Mimosa lovers can now add their preferred amount of juice to their champagne with Tropicana's new gadget.", "content": "Sounds a-peeling!

A year ago, a historically talented defense led the Bulldogs to their first national championship in 41 years. Five defensive starters -- end Travon Walker, tackles Jordan Davis and Devonte Wyatt, linebacker Quay Walker and safety Lewis Cine -- were selected in the first round of the NFL draft, the most from any school in the common era of the draft since 1967. Three other Georgia defenders -- linebackers Nakobe Dean and Channing Tindall and cornerback Derion Kendrick -- also were drafted, leaving the Bulldogs with only three returning defensive starters going into the 2022 season. The attrition has gotten worse since then. When the Bulldogs take on No. 1 Tennessee at Sanford Stadium on Saturday, only two players who started for Georgia's defense in its 33-18 victory against Alabama in the CFP National Championship game are expected to be on the field -- cornerback Kelee Ringo and safety Christopher Smith. The Bulldogs lost senior outside linebacker Nolan Smith to a season-ending pectoral muscle injury this week; safety William Poole left the team in September for personal reasons. Nonetheless, the Georgia defense that takes the field against the high-flying Volunteers in a game that might decide the SEC East title leads the conference in run defense (85.4 yards) and total defense (262.5 yards) and is second against the pass (177.1 yards). Not bad for a defense that also lost coordinator Dan Lanning, who left to become Oregon's head coach. Linebackers coach Glenn Schumann and special teams coordinator Will Muschamp, a former head coach at Florida and South Carolina, were promoted to co-defensive coordinators. \"It is just the standard,\" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \"Just because you lose good players does not mean you are not going to be good next year. Maybe that is an expectation that some teams have, but that is not the expectation of any team I have ever been a part of. The expectation is that you are going to be good because you recruit good players and because you coach hard.\" Few FBS coaches have recruited defensive players as well as Smart, a former Georgia defensive back and Alabama defensive coordinator. Seven of the Bulldogs' anticipated defensive starters for Saturday's game were ranked in the ESPN 300 as high school seniors. Linebacker Smael Mondon Jr. and safety Malaki Starks were ranked the No. 1 athletes in their respective classes in 2021 and 2022. Ringo was the No. 1 cornerback in the 2020 class. Jalen Carter was the No. 12 prospect overall and No. 2 defensive tackle in 2020. \"They are just big, smooth and efficient,\" said Samford coach Chris Hatcher, whose team lost 33-0 at Georgia on Sept. 30. \"If we thought we had a crease on them, I'd look up and we'd gained a yard and it's second-and-9. Knowing Kirby and Will because I worked with them, they're relentless recruiters. Some of those guys played last season in the national championship year because they had some blowout wins. Those backups got a lot of reps and they know the expectation there. I just have not seen that much of a drop-off from last year to this year.\" Through eight games, Georgia's defense stacks up well against last year's unit, at least statistically. The Bulldogs are second in the FBS in scoring defense, behind only Illinois. Georgia allowed 10.2 points per game in 2021; it is giving up 10.5 per game this season. Opponents gained 269 yards of offense per game last season; they're totaling 263 this season. Georgia's defense has been even better on third down. Last season, opponents converted 35% of third downs; they're moving the chains only 29% of the time this season. \"It all comes down to guys that are out there being coachable,\" Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker said. \"As you can see, they have some great coaches behind them, and they play extremely hard. That's something that you can't teach. The effort and attitude and toughness that they bring to the game is immaculate, and that's what SEC football is about. This is the top brand of football.\" Georgia hasn't played an offense as explosive as Tennessee's this season. It is just the second time the Bulldogs will face an offense that is ranked in the top 50 in the FBS in scoring offense, according to data from ESPN Stats & Information. Oregon, which is fifth in the country with 42.4 points per game, could manage only a field goal in a 49-3 loss to the Bulldogs in the Sept. 3 opener. The Volunteers lead the FBS in scoring (49.4 points) and total offense (553 yards per game) and are second in passing (353.4 yards). Hooker is a leading Heisman Trophy candidate, completing 71.2% of his passes for 2,338 yards with 21 touchdowns and one interception. Receiver Jalin Hyatt has 45 catches for 907 yards with 14 touchdowns, including a school-record five TDs in a 52-49 victory against Alabama on Oct. 15. As good as Georgia's defense was last season, the Volunteers still tested it in the Bulldogs' 41-17 victory at Neyland Stadium. Tennessee had 387 yards of offense, including 332 passing. Cedric Tillman had 10 catches for 200 yards with one score. With a second offseason in coach Josh Heupel's fast-break attack, the Volunteers have been even better this season. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, it will be the first game featuring an offense averaging 49 points or more against a defense allowing 11 or fewer in November or later since 1996. The Volunteers aren't one-dimensional, either. They're 25th in the FBS in rushing, with nearly 200 yards per game. Hooker is the team's third-leading rusher with 338 yards and four scores. \"Tennessee is not necessarily a pass-happy offense,\" Smart said. \"They run the ball really well. I think you could say that statistically they have explosive passes. They are a running team that chunks it deep. They do a really good job with explosive pass plays. They commit to the run. There is a toughness there. Their backs run really tough.\" One area Georgia's defense has lagged behind last season's unit is sack production. The Bulldogs have generated only 10 sacks and 39 tackles for loss, which ranks outside the top 100 in the FBS. \"You wouldn't call them vanilla by any stretch,\" Tennessee quarterbacks coach Joey Halzle said. \"They're a really good defense, we all know that. They've got guys that can rush the passer, they've got blitzers, they've got cover guys. You don't see a lot of flaws in their defense, especially looking at them from a personnel standpoint. They're well coached, they're in position, you see them flying to the football. That's why you don't see them giving up big plays, because they have a bunch of guys around the ball. \"You see guys that are well coached with a lot of eye discipline. It's not like they don't get home or they don't force it. They're making tackles, they're keeping everything in front of them, and they're making guys snap it again. Then they're doing a good job of getting off the field on third down.\" Losing Smith, who led the team with three sacks, seven tackles for loss and 16 quarterback hurries, won't make pressuring Hooker any easier. Sophomore Chaz Chambliss and freshman Marvin Jones Jr. will have to play more in his absence. \"Those guys have to play,\" Smart said. \"They practice every day just like Nolan does. They have to have an opportunity to go play. This is the next man up.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-24.596384048461914, -3.503974437713623]}, {"title": "Jaime Pressly talks new show, relationship with Leslie Jordan and rumors she's related to Elvis Presley", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jaime-pressly-talks-show-relationship-leslie-jordan-rumors-related-elvis-presley", "description": "Jaime Pressly talks about potentially being related to Elvis Presley and her relationship with Leslie Jordan.

The rumors that Jaime Pressly is related to late legendary rock \u2018n\u2019 roll musician Elvis Presley is something Pressly thinks could very much be a possibility, considering that she has heard the rumors from her own family members. Pressly told Fox News Digital that she heard that all the Presleys who came to America arrived from the same place and settled in North Carolina. According to her, stories have been floating around between her family members about a feud that broke up the family, which would explain the different spellings of their last name and some of them moving away. \"The story is that the original spelling was P-R-E-S-L-E-Y, which is how Elvis spelt his, and the story is that there was some kind of family feud way back in the day and some moved farther south and some stayed right where they were in North Carolina,\" Pressly told Fox News Digital. There are rumors that Jaime Pressly is related to Elvis Presley but a feud within the family caused them to split. (Getty Images) ELVIS PRESLEY\u2019S STEPBROTHER SAYS HE SPOKE OF GOD\u2019S FORGIVENESS BEFORE HIS DEATH: 'IN TOUCH WITH THE LORD' Something that adds to the lore among her family members is the similarities in appearance between Pressly's grandfather and Elvis' father. Pressly says that when the two pictures are \"put side by side, you can't tell him apart,\" even going a step further and saying, \"When you look at the men in (her) family,\" there are many \"similarities in the traits, facial features and things like that.\" \"But I mean, God, who knows?\" she said. \"I mean, weren't we all related at some point? Ancestry-wise, if you look back at where everybody came from, every, you know, look at the last names, they all came from the same place. You know what I mean?\" When speaking with Fox News Digital, Pressly also discussed her role on the FOX sitcom \"Welcome to Flatch,\" a mockumentary-style show that focuses on a small town in the Midwest and the eccentric characters who live there. Pressly plays the character Barb Flatch, a descendant of one of the town's founders who moves back home when she finds out her husband has been cheating on her. \"I was in North Carolina at my house on the island with the boys this past summer, the week before we were coming back to L.A., my team calls me and says, 'Hey, you know \u2026 you've been offered one of the new leads on the show \u2018Welcome to Flash,\u2019 which I'd never seen it or even heard of it.\" \"They said, \u2018You need to watch the first season on Hulu,\u2019 so I did. And I fell in love,\" Pressly said. \"I really liked the way that it shot like a \u2026 mockumentary. It kind of has that \u2018The Office\u2019 vibe, and I'm huge fan of Jenny Becks, the creator, as well as Paul Feig and all of the films that he's directed.\" Jaime Pressly is currently starring in FOX's sitcom \"Welcome to Flatch.\" (FOX via Getty Images) Pressly described her character as one of the most high-maintenance one's she has ever played, explaining that she is \"decked out to the nines at all times\" with a wig for every mood and all kinds of different jewelry.

My God, I've got bruises and blisters that I'm going to have for life from the heels that that woman wears, but it all makes up for a really great, fun character that I get to play,\" she said. Prior to her starring role on \"Welcome to Flatch,\" Pressly starred as Jill on the sitcom \"Mom\" for seven seasons. While filming for that show, they neighbored the set of \"Call Me Kat,\" which starred the late Leslie Jordan . Pressly said that she, along with the rest of the \"Mom\" cast, were big fans of Jordan and would always wait in the hallway in the hopes of meeting him as he walked past. After finally getting to meet him in the hallway one day, Pressly said they began seeing each other more often. They would bond over their Southern roots, and their friendship grew from there, with Pressly saying she \"absolutely adored him.\" While starring on \"Mom,\" Pressly, right, admitted the entire cast would wait in the hallway in the hopes of meeting late actor Leslie Jordan (not pictured).

Only we knew what we were saying,\" Pressly said. \"I had the same relationship that all his fans have as a fan. I've watched him in everything since I was a little girl, and he was just, he was magic. He was a force to be reckoned with. \u2026 He did so many things for so many people and so many charities, and he was always about giving back, so he will definitely be missed by everybody.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaime Pressly (@jaimepressly) Pressly also got candid about motherhood. The actress is mom to three boys, Desi James Calvo, 15, and twin boys Lenon and Leo Hijazi, 5. After becoming a mother, Pressly learned not to take things for granted and to appreciate every moment in life, even those moments that seem ordinary. \"When we get older, we take things for granted, but when you have children, you get to see everything with a new set of eyes again where everything's exciting again,\" she explained. \"Whether it's Christmas or Easter or Halloween, it's always more exciting for them, which makes it exciting for us again.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaime Pressly (@jaimepressly) As for what she finds most rewarding about being a parent?

Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Visitors watch a news broadcast showing file footage of a North Korean missile test at the ferry terminal of South Korea's eastern island of Ulleungdo, in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, on Thursday. SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea kept up its intensive launching of missiles, firing three more on Thursday after setting a record the previous day with 23 launches. The projectiles, including a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile, have triggered alerts, prompting some residents to seek shelter in two countries \u2014 South Korea and Japan \u2014 on both days. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the launches \"intolerable.\" Japan's government initially issued an alert for three prefectures, saying the ICBM had flown over the main island of Honshu, but later corrected the statement. North Korea last fired an intermediate range missile over Japan on Oct. 4. \"North Korea staged a very threatening provocation at a magnitude we've never seen before,\" says Kim Jeong-dae, a former defense official and visiting professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \"First, they launched missiles from all around the country \u2014 east, west, south, north,\" he explains. \"This seems intended to negate our strategy of striking the source of attack.\" He adds that the quantity of projectiles suggests that North Korea has produced ample stockpiles of weapons. Wednesday's launches marked the first time a North Korean missile had flown over the de facto maritime border separating the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953. One flew toward Ulleung Island off South Korea's east coast, triggering air raid sirens, before dropping in the sea. While missiles did not land in South Korea's territorial waters, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called the launch \"tantamount to violating South Korea's territory.\" South Korea responded by firing two air-to-ground missiles across the maritime border into international waters. Launching them so close to South Korean territory, Kim Jeong-dae says, could be seen as a kind of \"area denial strategy that blocks the combined forces [of the U.S. and South Korea] from approaching North Korea.\" \"And the region where the North Korean missile fell,\" he adds, \"has many fishing boats catching squid,\" suggesting that it could put South Koreans' livelihoods at risk, and \"pose existential threat to South Korea, if need be.\" North Korea has accused the U.S. of preparing to attack it, possibly with nuclear weapons, in order to justify its missile launches. Pyongyang points to this week's U.S.-South Korean joint air force drills , involving some 240 military aircraft flying a record of about 1,600 sorties. Last week, it pointed to 12 days of \"National Defense\" field exercises . While the allies insist the drills are defensive in nature, they are aimed at defeating threats from North Korea. Pyongyang has fumed at the U.S. deployment of \"strategic assets\" such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines to the area around the Korean peninsula to deter and respond to North Korean provocations. Pyongyang has called the deployments a threat to regional stability. And it especially bristles at U.S. and South Korean military exercises that simulate \"decapitation\" strikes against North Korea's leadership. Of course, even without the pretext of U.S. and South Korean military exercises, North Korea is likely to be testing many nuclear weapons and missiles for years to come. It's a part of a five-year plan to beef up its nuclear and missile arsenals, in hopes of forcing the U.S. to make concessions, such as sanctions relief and recognition of Pyongyang as a nuclear weapons state. Washington insists these will not happen. As dramatic as this week's military muscle flexing may seem, North Korea has reportedly completed preparations to top it off with the test-detonation of an atomic bomb, if it so chooses. While this has been predicted for months, Pyongyang may think that timing it to coincide with U.S. midterm elections would yield extra political impact.

On his \u201cLate Show,\u201d the funnyman accused Republican Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon of inventing a story about a Democratic voter who changed his party affiliation to the GOP due to his frustration about \u201cpornographic\u201d materials in libraries. But it turns out the supposedly fictitious man is very real . Khalil Othman, 41, a former Dearborn City Council candidate, came forward as the man Dixon had referred to at a debate against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Oct. 25, the Detroit Free Press reported . \u201cTo claim that I\u2019m not here, I don\u2019t exist, I\u2019m not human, that\u2019s absolute ignorance,\u201d Othman told the newspaper. In Colbert\u2019s monologue the day after the debate, the comedian joked about the voter\u2019s concerns about sexually-explicit materials being found in libraries. \u201cDixon\u2019s not the only one worried about this issue. So is this guy she totally made up,\u201d Colbert said. Colbert then played a clip of Dixon recounting how she had been approached by Othman, a father of five, about his frustration with the Democrats. \u201cI had a gentleman come up to me just a few nights ago and he said, \u2018I found content in my school library describing how to have sex to my son,\u2019\u201d Dixon said in the clip of the debate. \u201cHe said \u2018just a few weeks ago, not only was I a Democrat, but I was running for office as a Democrat.\u2019 He said because Democrats won\u2019t stand up for our children and go back to the basics, \u2018I\u2019m leaving the Democratic Party,\u2019\u201d Dixon added. In his monologue, Colbert described Dixon as an \u201canti-choice MAGA Republican\u201d and mocked her account about the Democrat-turned-Republican. \u201cOK, fine, that happened,\u201d he said sarcastically, using air quotes to drive home his skepticism. During a campaign stop in Dearborn on Sunday, Dixon hit back at Colbert. \u201cI told his story (during the debate),\u201d she told the hundreds in attendance, according to the Free Press. \u201cAnd Stephen Colbert picks it up. \u2026 And they make this whole skit about how this has never happened. That\u2019s what he said, this story never happened. That\u2019s where the Democrats are right now. You don\u2019t exist, your stories are not important,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, Othman shared a video on Facebook of his initial meeting with Dixon at an Oct. 21 rally in Flat Rock. \u201cMy name is Khalil Othman. I came all the way from Dearborn, Michigan. I\u2019m here along with two parents, concerned parents \u2026 against these sexually explicit books,\u201d he said to cheers in the clip. \u201cI am a proud Muslim-American who expresses my values and concerns all the time,\u201d Othman continued. \u201cDearborn has been voting Democrat blue for the last decade or two decades. But not anymore. On behalf of myself and my family, I guarantee you for sure that my family and my friends will vote for Republicans.\u201d In an interview with the Detroit Free Press, Othman slammed Colbert for suggesting that the candidate\u2019s account about him was fake. \u201cIf this person did his due diligence and start researching or has his team do a little bit of research of who\u2019s this person who attended Dixon\u2019s rally, they will be able to find my name right away easy on social media.

The Army veteran recently spoke with The Post\u2019s Scott Fontana via Zoom for this week\u2019s Post Fight Interview. Q: You were once a Brooklyn kid way back, right? A: I was born and raised in Brooklyn until right around middle school, high school. Q: What was life like for you in New York? A: Different, for sure. Growing up in New York, my mom was a single mom, and I had five siblings. So we pretty much bounced all over Brooklyn. I lived in Flatbush, Canarsie, Bushwick. I was living all over Brooklyn growing up as a kid. And right around middle school, high school range, that\u2019s when my grandmother decided to try to help my mom raise us. She was able to move us out to Illinois and have me go to school there for a bit. Q: Do you have any fond memories of your time growing up in Brooklyn? A: Just the normal things that Brooklyn kids do growing up. I remember the summer block parties, that kind of thing. Being on a stoop all day long, no particular place to go, just kind of hanging out there, the old milk crate on a tree for a basketball hoop type of thing (laughs). Just your basic Brooklyn memories growing up as a kid. Nothing too crazy or anything like that.. Q: A win this Saturday breaks a tie with Georges St-Pierre for most all-time at welterweight. You already passed him in total fight time at 170. What does it mean personally to be in the same company as a great champion like him? A: Man, it\u2019s great. \u2026 The only thing that\u2019s within my control is my consistency and how hard I\u2019m able to work. And being able to be recognized [with] George St-Pierre for the most amount of wins in the welterweight division, that\u2019s just a testimony to my hard work in the sport. Q: You\u2019re starting to trend toward chasing the all-time UFC fights record \u2014 currently held by Jim Miller and climbing. Is that something you might chase? A: Yeah, for sure. Any way to get into history books with the UFC, I\u2019m all for it. If it means the most amount of wins out there, sign me up. I\u2019ll get there one way or the other. So anything that gets me recognized with some of the great guys that came before me in this sport, I\u2019m all for it. Leave my mark where I can. Q: You had missed out on that chance last time out against Shavkat Rakhmonov in June. A lot of people think he has championship upside. You\u2019ve beaten three former UFC champions in your career; what\u2019s your read on him now that you\u2019ve been in there with him? A: Not to take anything away from the guy \u2014 he\u2019s definitely a great competitor. He has a very well-rounded skill set, and he definitely showed it in [my] fight against him. I definitely do think he\u2019d be up there with the contenders in the UFC. \u2026 The guy\u2019s a very good grappler. He\u2019s a very decent striker, and he has good wrestling, and those are all the tools you need to make a great fighter, so to speak. So he definitely possesses those skill sets. And he\u2019s gonna do great things in this sport with that. But, with that being said, I\u2019m really bitter about that fight still (laughs). With all the fights in the UFC, I\u2019ve yet to earn a rematch. That\u2019s definitely a rematch that\u2019s burning me to go out there and earn. Q: You\u2019re next facing Rodriguez, a fight that was supposed to take place a few weeks ago but was postponed by his injury. How does a change like that affect your preparation for a fight? A: Honestly, for this one, it played out very well for me. I had a teammate that was struggling with a lot of things. He had a very tragic situation in his family where he ultimately lost his brother. And he was supposed to be fighting the same week that I was, and because of all the circumstances, it would be very difficult for other teammates and coaches to make it out to his fight. So [when] my fight got pulled back, I was excited. I was like, \u201cWait, my fight\u2019s postponed; it\u2019s not canceled? I\u2019m all for it.\u201d So I was super excited to go out there and support my teammate. I Immediately got on the phone with UFC and booked the flight to go out to Iowa for my teammate, and it worked out great. He was able to go out there and get the win, and I was able to be there to support him, physically and mentally, throughout it all. So I feel like it worked out exactly how it\u2019s supposed to. And with that being said, also the fact that I was going out there to support him, it kind of forced me to be away from the gym and not overtrain myself. Kind of gave me the necessary break I needed, with the fight getting pushed back an additional three weeks. Q: He\u2019s coming off the split decision win over Li Jingliang, which a lot of people felt The Leech had won. Do you have any thoughts on that fight and the decision? A: That\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s always a toss up to see how a judge is gonna weigh in on a fight. If you watch a total fight, it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cOK, cool. That guy won that fight in particular.\u201d But when it comes to MMA, the fight is broken down amongst individual rounds, so it all boils down to what the judges saw in each particular round that made him reward the decision one way or the other. In my personal opinion, overall, I thought The Leech did enough to win the fight. But for my own personal selfish reasons, I was excited to get a new opponent because I knew following that decision win that he\u2019ll be ranked come Tuesday morning. So I was like, \u201cOh sweet, a new face in the top 15. A new opponent for me.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that the opponent would come back quickly, but I was excited to have some fresh blood, so to speak, in the waters. Q: Do you recall your first experience watching MMA? A: I remember being in high school, about a sophomore or so, and it was when Matt Hughes and Rich Franklin were coaching \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter.\u201d Then I was like, Man, this is kind of cool. I really like this. But at the time, it wasn\u2019t super mainstream where it was anywhere you can go to train mixed martial arts in particular. There were some places here and there for Taekwondo or karate or that kind of thing. But as far as the overall game of mixed martial arts, or jiu-jitsu or kickboxing, it was very rare to find. So it wasn\u2019t until my junior year, going into my senior year, my football coach actually got us a membership for a local gym to keep in shape in the summer. And at that time, Miguel Torres was actually renting studio space from that gym to run his martial arts program. And I remember walking in there the first time, just kind of looking over like, \u201cHuh, this is kind of cool. What are those guys doing there?\u201d But at the time, I was just like, Whatever, I\u2019ll let them do their thing. I can\u2019t afford it. I can\u2019t go there and just ask for lessons. My buddies would wait, so after training, we sneak onto the mat area and grab the boxing gloves, go mess around, and that kind of thing. We did that for probably a good month or so. And finally, after a while I\u2019m like, You know what, screw it, I\u2019m gonna see what it\u2019s gonna cost to go in there. I\u2019m gonna wait till Miguel shows up and try to have a conversation and see if I can train. And as soon as I saw him, I\u2019m like \u201cHey, man, I\u2019m really interested in what you guys are doing here. I kind of know what mixed martial arts is; I kind of know what jiu-jitsu is, but I want to get a more in-depth feel of what this sport actually is and what it entails. And he said, \u201cHave you trained before?\u201d Like, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve wrestled in high school, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cOK, cool. Go buy a mouth guard, get a cup and meet me here tomorrow.\u201d And sure enough, I go home like, well, I\u2018ve got a cup. I don\u2019t have a mouth guard. Maybe they\u2019ll let me train anyway. So I just show up the next day like, \u201cOK, I got what I need. Let\u2019s go. I\u2019m ready to train.\u201d And my very first training session was actually sparring with Miguel Torres, and he goes and cracks me right in the teeth with a jab to the point that he actually chipped my tooth. And I was like, \u201cHuh, this feels weird, but in a weird way, I like it. I want to keep doing it.\u201d And that was my first intro to mixed martial arts in general, getting an opportunity to train with Miguel Torres as a 17-year-old kid. Q: Typical walkaround weight between fights? A: Between 185 and 190 [pounds]. If I\u2019m not training, I\u2019m not really like watching what I eat, I may get close to 195 or so. Q: Typical weight on fight night? A: Same. [On] fight night, I usually weigh about 186, 187. On a lighter night, probably \u201884 or so. I\u2019ve been competing at 170 since I was 14 years old. Q: What\u2019s the coolest technique in combat sports? A: One of the best ones is that tradition Mighty Mouse [Demetrious Johnson] did a couple of years ago, where he went from a takedown immediately into the armbar. To get that lift, return and put the armbar the way he did, it\u2019s almost impossible to pull off in training. It\u2019s even more difficult to pull it off live in a fight \u2014 in a championship fight.

Jacobia Dahm for NPR hide caption The Tesla factory in Gruenheide, about 20 miles southeast of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg, on Oct. 26. Tesla opened the factory \u2014 its first in Germany \u2014 earlier this year in an area characterized by its forests and small lakes. The company has already started clearing trees for an expansion, pending approval from regulators. BRANDENBURG, Germany \u2014 Deep in the pine woods just southeast of Berlin is a massive Tesla factory that opened earlier this year as Europe's first manufacturing outpost for Elon Musk's electric vehicle company. The site's main facility has the same amount of space as 130 soccer fields, and it is humming with activity, churning out a few thousand vehicles a week. But Musk's plan to triple the size of the operation is running up against one big problem: The plant is in a drought-stricken part of the country where water is scarce , and it takes a substantial amount of water to do things like paint exteriors, cast vehicle parts and cool heavy machinery. Tesla's contract with the German government estimates that the expanded factory will use 1.4 million cubic meters of water every year, or roughly the same amount of water that a city of more than 30,000 people would consume. So, as local leaders and Tesla officials scramble to find enough water to keep expanding the site, already the largest employer in this bucolic slice of eastern Germany, residents are worried about the possibility of a major shortage. Local activist and politician Thomas Loeb, 55, in front of the Tesla factory in Gruenheide on Oct. 26. Loeb is concerned that the factory poses a risk to the groundwater, forest and wildlife around it, and that Tesla has not been transparent about its manufacturing processes and developments. Jacobia Dahm for NPR hide caption Local activist and politician Thomas Loeb, 55, in front of the Tesla factory in Gruenheide on Oct. 26. Loeb is concerned that the factory poses a risk to the groundwater, forest and wildlife around it, and that Tesla has not been transparent about its manufacturing processes and developments. \"The water problems are huge,\" said local activist Thomas Loeb, who is a member of Germany's Ecological Democratic Party. \"And it's getting worse. We're getting less and less rain. If Tesla keeps needing more, the people will no longer have any drinking water.\" The expansion of the site, officially named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, is now on hold pending approval from environmental authorities. Tesla officials feel confident an additional build-out will be blessed by regulators, since the company has already started clearing trees in preparation. But environmental activists and residents are right to be concerned about the strain of the factory's potential increased water demand, even if it pales in comparison to other industries, like coal-fired power plants in the area, said Irina Engelhardt, who heads the hydrogeology department at Berlin's Technical University. \"Due to a decreasing water availability and increasing water demand, there is a mismatch,\" said Engelhardt, who has pointed out that eventually there might not be enough water for everyone. Brandenburg's years-long severe drought has created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. Farmers in the area have reported severe harvest loss as a result of intense heat and the lack of rain, both effects of climate change, according to experts. The water dispute has prompted lawsuits, and it caused the Tesla plant to delay its opening by six months. But Elon Musk literally laughed off the water problem when asked about it at a press conference last fall. \"This is completely wrong. There is water everywhere here,\" Musk said. \"Does this seem like a desert to you?\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk (right) and Armin Laschet, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia at the time, speak with the press during a tour of the Tesla plant in Gruenheide on Aug. 13, 2021.

Mention Musk's remarks to Brandenburg's finance minister, Joerg Steinbach, and his eyes widen. \"In terms of the perception in the region, this was not 100% helpful,\" Steinbach said. Steinbach was a key figure in enticing Tesla to open a plant in Germany. He said he has long known that building it up to full capacity would mean grappling with local water limitations. \"If you always use the water which is directly under your feet, you always run into that problem of whether it's sufficient for public use as well as industrial use,\" he said.

Jacobia Dahm for NPR hide caption The Loecknitz River, a tributary of the Elbe, near the Tesla factory in Gruenheide on Oct. 26. Government officials have been scouring the area for new water sources and have drilled wells in Hangelsberg, about 9 miles away from the plant. Steinbach said planners are now installing pipes from the wells to the Brandenburg factory. He would not say when he expects the project to be completed. Engelhardt, the water expert at Berlin's Technical University, is skeptical that piping in water from another part of eastern Germany will be an enduring solution. The new wells are \"in my mind not a very sustainable and promising solution, as the water scarcity is similar in most parts of Southeast Brandenburg,\" she said. \"I'm afraid there will be a time when a water shortage for some use will be a reality.\" Building out the site in Germany is crucial to Tesla meeting its global demand for electric cars. Right now, the factory is making about 2,000 cars a week. Musk hopes to bring that number up to 5,000, but hurdles keep getting in the way. \"It's probably a bit of a culture shock for Tesla, especially for their boss, for their chief executive, Elon Musk,\" said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based analyst who tracks electric cars in Europe. It's not just water. Local activists fighting Tesla on everything from tree preservation to saving sand lizards have delayed the timeline.

Jacobia Dahm for NPR hide caption Two old signs in the forest declaring the area a nature reserve in Gruenheide on Oct. 26. The top sign dates to the time when Germany was still divided and the area belonged to East Germany. \"It's gotten to the stage with the Tesla facility that these pressure groups are slowing the progress down,\" Schmidt said. It is a matter of perspective. Musk complains about delays, but German businesspeople talk about the relatively fast clip of the site's development as moving at \"Tesla speed\" \u2014 which is a sore point for local activists, who say there was not sufficient community input before the sprawling site was approved. Getting Tesla's German factory operating at full capacity is crucial for Tesla to meet its growth targets in Europe, where about 20% of new cars sold are fully electric vehicles. Last month, European lawmakers reached a deal to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2035. In the United States, California has also pledged to end gasoline car sales by that date. Tesla, the world's most valuable car company, faces growing competition in the electric vehicle market from Volkswagen, GM, BMW and others. Analysts expect it to double the number of electric vehicles it produces in the coming years, using major plants in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai, as well as Germany. Back at his government office, Steinbach notes that in surveys his department has conducted, the majority of residents in the Brandenburg area support the factory, which now employs about 7,000 workers. When the factory is fully built out, the company expects its workforce in Germany to be around 12,000. But on Musk himself, like in America, people are divided. \"Fifty percent see the messiah in Elon Musk and Tesla. And for 50% it's coming from the devil,\" he said.

During his testimony, the \"Million Dollar Baby\" filmmaker testified that he believed he had a consensual sexual encounter with a woman and acted on what he believed was a mutual attraction. Publicist Haleigh Breest alleges that Haggis forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her in 2013 as she repeatedly told him no.

Haggis agreed with some parts of his accuser\u2019s account of how she ended up alone with him in his downtown Manhattan loft. He offered her a ride home from a movie premiere and invited her for a drink at his apartment. She responded by suggesting a bar instead. When he said he preferred the apartment, she accepted but told him she was not spending the night. Paul Haggis took the stand on Wednesday and maintained the sexual encounter in 2013 was consensual.

Scientists say climate change helped drive the deadly floods. AAMIR QURESHI/AFP via Getty Images hide caption People wade through floodwaters in Pakistan after heavy monsoon rains this summer. Scientists say climate change helped drive the deadly floods. Developing countries are going to need a lot more money to deal with the risks they face from climate change, according to a new United Nations report released on Thursday. The impacts from global warming have hit the world's poorest countries especially hard so far, even though they're responsible for a relatively small share of the greenhouse gasses that are causing temperatures to rise. Flooding in Pakistan this summer that killed at least 1500 people and a multi-year drought in East Africa are evidence of \"mounting and ever-increasing climate risks,\" the UN report says. To help developing nations prepare for more extreme storms, heat waves and floods, industrialized countries gave them around $29 billion in 2020. But that's a fraction of what the developing world needs in order to reduce the damage from extreme weather events, the report says. By the end of the decade, developing countries will likely need up to about 10 times more money every year to adapt to a hotter planet. By midcentury, those annual costs could soar to more than $500 billion. \"The message of this report is clear: strong political will is needed to increase adaptation investments and outcomes,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, wrote in a foreword to the report. \"If we don't want to spend the coming decades in emergency response mode, dealing with disaster after disaster, we need to get ahead of the game,\" she added. The UN published the report days before its annual climate conference starts in Egypt. In a separate report published last week, the UN said the world isn't cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly enough to avoid potentially catastrophic sea level rise and other global dangers. The UN climate negotiations scheduled to begin over the weekend in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh are the 27th Conference of the Parties, or COP27. They are expected to focus on efforts to boost the amount of money that's available to deal with climate change, especially in developing countries.

The newly-planted mangroves are part of a program to boost biodiversity, protect coastlines and fight climate change and its impacts. Industrialized nations still haven't delivered on a longstanding pledge to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change and to cut emissions in order to limit further warming, or what's known as climate mitigation. Of the $83.3 billion developing countries received in 2020, most of the money went to mitigation projects , not adaptation, according to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. \"The discourse needs to be raised significantly, the level of ambition, so that you can actually continue to do what you're doing on mitigation even more, but you at the same time meet the adaptation needs,\" says Mafalda Duarte, CEO of Climate Investment Funds, which works with development banks like the World Bank to provide funding to developing countries on favorable terms. To prepare for more extreme weather, the world needs to invest more money in projects to reduce the hazards, vulnerability and exposure that people face, the UN says. That could include building water reservoirs in areas at risk of drought, ensuring infrastructure is built to stand up to the impacts of a hotter climate, and providing communities with early warning systems to help people evacuate in emergencies. At the end of last year's UN climate conference, developed countries were urged to at least double their funding for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025. However, the UN says even that amount of money would be insufficient to address the needs that exist in developing nations to prepare for climate risk. The UN also warned that issues unrelated to climate change, including worldwide inflation and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, could limit how much money wealthier countries are willing to provide developing nations for adaptation. Duarte says that failing to spend the money that's necessary to limit and prepare for climate change exposes the entire world to potential risks. Those risks could include armed conflicts, refugee crises and disruptions in financial markets, analysts say. \"We have to change our mindset and the way we think, because, actually, when it comes to climate, you know, an investment across borders in other places is a domestic investment,\" Duarte says.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.778034210205078, -4.211834907531738]}, {"title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom feared \u2018she was going to die\u2019 before singer\u2019s bipolar diagnosis", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/my-mind-and-me-doc-selena-gomezs-mom-feared-she-would-die/", "description": "Gomez shares a rare glimpse into her battle with mental health struggles, a lupus-induced kidney transplant and a bipolar diagnosis in a new documentary.", "content": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mother, Mandy Teefey, was scared for her daughter\u2019s life the moment she learned the popstar was having a mental breakdown during her 2016 Revival tour. \u201cWe heard about her mental breakdown through TMZ.

In 2016, she went to rehab again for anxiety and depression in Tennessee amid her Revival World Tour, prompting her to cancel the remaining tour dates. A year later, she had a kidney transplant from her best friend, Gomez revealed.

Still, with the Astros owning a 5-0 lead thanks to an onslaught of offense in the top of the sixth inning, Baker decided it was time to call Javier out of the game.

America First Legal , an organization launched by former Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller, is behind many of the political ads targeting transgender kids that have run in at least 25 states. Research from the Human Rights Campaign indicates that \"a significant portion\" of the ad spending has been directed toward Black and Spanish-speaking voters through radio, mail, TV and digital means. America First Legal spent $4 million to get its ads on Black and Spanish-language radio in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The narrator of an America First Legal radio ad accuses President Biden of pushing children to take cross-sex hormone medication and get gender-affirming surgery. \"The Biden administration is pushing radical gender experiments on children, changing their names, clothes, identities and bodies,\" the narrator says. \"They want boys in our daughters' bathrooms and sports teams.\" Citizens for Sanity, another group formed by former Trump administration aides, spent $20 million on TV ads in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania that focus on illegal immigration, crime and other issues. Both America First Legal and Citizens for Sanity do not make any mention of candidates running for office in their ads. Polling shows that transgender-related issues are not typically a top priority for voters , but controversies surrounding transgender athletes competing in women's sports have made headlines this year. Yale University swimmer Iszac Henig and then-University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas broke records in the Ivy League championships in February, stirring debate as to whether transgender women should be allowed to compete on women's teams. In June, the world governing body for swimming, FINA, voted to effectively ban transgender women from women's swimming competitions. Another radio ad funded by America First Legal that spread in October promoted claims of \"anti-white bigotry\" and accused the White House of putting white people last in line for COVID-19 relief funds. \"When did racism against white people become OK?\" the narrator says. \"The left's anti-white bigotry must stop.\" Miller has been seen as pushing for an anti-immigrant , white nationalist agenda since his time as Trump's chief immigration adviser. In 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it obtained hundreds of leaked emails in which Miller detailed white nationalist ideas.

Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images hide caption The Justice has released a report on sexual assault cases by guards against federal prisoners. Federal prosecutors must use \"all available tools\" to hold federal corrections employees who sexually abuse women in their custody accountable \u2014 including a new law that carries a penalty of as many as 15 years behind bars, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco instructed in a new memo late Wednesday to Justice Department officials and obtained by NPR. \"The Department's obligation to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in our custody is enduring,\" Monaco wrote. Her directive follows a high-level review this year that uncovered hundreds of complaints about sexual misconduct by Bureau of Prisons employees over the past five years, but only 45 federal prosecutions during that same period. \"The recurrence of this egregious conduct over multiple facilities poses serious concerns,\" according to the review findings. The working group identified weak or nonexistent administrative discipline against some prison workers \u2014 and flaws in how prosecutors assessed reports of abuse. In one case in Florida, authorities declined to prosecute corrections officer Jimmy Highsmith after first receiving tips about him in 2010, only to reverse course years later. In March 2022, a judge sentenced Highsmith to 48 months in prison for repeated sexual misconduct against one incarcerated woman over nine months. The report stressed the need to prevent sexual misconduct in the first place \u2013 highlighting recommendations to develop an early warning system by taking notice of officers who routinely show up late after prison rounds; beefing up the presence of security cameras to plug \"blind spots\" inside prison facilities; and raising pay for wardens who work in 29 prisons for women across the United States. Pay has been tied to the security level of a prison. Facilities for women are designated as low or medium-security compared to higher level designations for prisons for men. The working group urged the Bureau of Prisons to develop a hotline that incarcerated women and their families and friends could use to report sexual abuse and to stress the availability of confidential reporting. That's critical since many women in prison face threats of retaliation, including threats by wrongdoers to limit women's visits with their children. The group also recommended that moving women who report abuse into restricted housing units should be a \"last resort.\" Often, those women are transferred into special housing units, where they lose access to phone calls, commissary access and other privileges, which can add to their trauma. Finally, the group said, the Bureau of Prisons should rethink who and how it investigates complaints of sexual abuse by women behind bars. Currently the prisons assign officers to take initial statements who may be friends or colleagues of the alleged perpetrators, raising questions about conflicts of interest. Instead, the Justice Department should consider creating a special unit or task force of sex crimes investigators, a kind of special victims' unit that could include agents from the FBI or the Inspector General, and align with how many large cities already investigate sexual abuse. The new report tread gingerly on an issue of ongoing deliberation: whether women who report abuse and agree to testify against their abusers should be eligible for reduced prison sentences or U.S. visas. The study said prosecutors and the BOP should make case-by-case assessments about those issues, and said they may be best suited after a case or investigation has ended. The working group said the authorities who initially prosecuted the women should be consulted on any such step, as well as the victims of the underlying conviction. Survivors of abuse inside a prison in Dublin, Calif. , where five Bureau of Prisons employees have been charged with crimes, including a warden and a chaplain, have been pressing for compassionate release. \"They were not sentenced to being raped in prison, and not only were they raped, they turned around at great cost and cooperated with the investigation of this warden and this chaplain,\" said Kevin Ring, who advocates for people in prison and their families. \"And you're going to say we have no power to give them relief, that they're supposed to heal inside a prison?\" The report said Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is considering whether to modify current prison policy on compassionate release. The working group, led by principal associate deputy attorney general Marshall Miller, met with formerly incarcerated women who survived abuse in prison, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, Centro Legal De La Raza, and the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.031550407409668, 8.766923904418945]}, {"title": "Delivery man: Ryan's 3 lifts Lakers to OT in win", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34937454/matt-ryan-clutch-3-sends-lakers-ot-way-2nd-straight-win?device=featurephone", "description": "Matt Ryan hit a tying corner 3-pointer off a pinpoint crosscourt inbounds pass to send the Lakers to overtime on their way to their second straight win.", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- As sick as LeBron James felt coming into Wednesday's game against the New Orleans Pelicans -- bedridden by a virus that even caused him to miss the team Halloween party -- he surely would have felt sicker if the Los Angeles Lakers blew a 16-point lead and fell to 1-6. Turns out that Matt Ryan was just what the doctor ordered. Ryan hit a tying corner 3-pointer off a pinpoint crosscourt inbounds pass from Austin Reaves at the end of regulation, and L.A. held on in overtime 120-117 to win its second game in a row. \"Today was the first day I got out of bed since Sunday night,\" said James, who finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. \"There's something going around, and it hit me pretty good. It hurt me to my soul to miss the Halloween party with all of my guys on Monday.\" While James missed the festivities, the Lakers have dressed up as a successful team their past couple of games after starting the season 0-5. And the clouds have parted ever so slightly for a team that has already had more than its fair share of injuries and roster scrutiny to begin the season. \"My confidence is, when it comes to shooting, it's unwavering,\" said Ryan, who was 2-for-8 from 3 the day before hitting the big one. \"I mean, I wouldn't be here if that wasn't the case.\" Coach Darvin Ham said he called for the play to go to Ryan, who was a DoorDash delivery driver before playing in one game for the Boston Celtics last season. He came to the Lakers as a training camp invitee and earned a partially guaranteed contract thanks to his outside shooting performance in the preseason. \"I kind of just felt in my gut that [the Pelicans] know Matt is a threat to shoot it but I would be using him as some type of decoy for someone else,\" Ham said. \"But the play was definitely intended for him. Austin threw a hell of a pass.\" The Lakers wouldn't have been in that position if not for missing five straight shots in the last minute and a half of the fourth quarter that preceded Ryan's shot. And if not for a little luck, too. Pelicans rookie Dyson Daniels missed two free throws with 1.6 seconds left that could have iced the game. Had he made even one out of two, Ryan's shot would have been moot. \"We didn't deserve to win that game, so credit to the Lakers, they did what they needed to do,\" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. Time will tell whether the mini win streak is a sign of bigger things to come for the Lakers or a brief respite in a season full of nightly battles in the Western Conference. To that point, L.A.'s next opponent Friday, the Utah Jazz, are 6-3 despite trading away both of their All-Stars in Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert during the offseason. There won't be a lot of easy nights, and many results could come down to something as miniscule as a Daniels free throw or a Ryan 3. \"Just keep this feeling,\" Anthony Davis (20 points, 16 rebounds, 4 blocks) said on the key to the Lakers building on their current momentum. \"Just kept fighting, trying to stay in this moment of remembering how winning feels. We want to continue to do it. \"It's starting to click, starting to find things. Find rotations, find situations where we were really good. And guys are staying ready, coming in and playing well.

A mother and daughter come out to their yard. \u201cWe are looking for sexual crimes,\u201d the prosecutor, Oleksandr Kleshchenko, says. Until early October, this area of the country was occupied by Russian troops. Burnt-out cars litter the fields. The letter \u2018Z\u2019 \u2013 a symbol used by Russian forces \u2013 marks the walls. The scars of war run deep here. Russia has used sexual violence as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d \u2013 a deliberate \u201cmilitary strategy\u201d \u2013 in its conquest of Ukraine, United Nations investigators have said . They have even relayed allegations of Russian soldiers carrying Viagra. Russian authorities have denied accusations of war crimes in Ukraine. In two weeks of work in the Kherson region, the team from Kyiv has documented six allegations of sexual assault. The real number is almost certainly much higher, they say. Tatiana, age 56, says she is one of the victims. CNN is withholding her last name and that of her village to protect her identity. Walking over broken glass, she shows us into her brother\u2019s house, where she says two Russian soldiers forced their way through her door on August 26. \u201cThey walked around those rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cOne stayed there, and the other one, who raped me, came in here. He came in, walked a little bit around the room and here in this place, he started groping me.\u201d Russia using rape as 'military strategy' in Ukraine: UN envoy \u201cI told him, \u2018No, no, I am not of the age that I can give you something, look for younger girls.\u2019\u201d He pinned her against the wardrobe, she says, and tore at her clothes. \u201cI was crying, begging him to stop, but with no success,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thought I had was to stay alive.\u201d He warned her not to tell anyone, she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell my husband right away,\u201d she says, in tears. \u201cBut I told my cousin, and my husband overheard. He said, \u2018You should have told me the truth, but you kept silent.\u2019\u201d \u201cI was very ashamed,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish that he and all his kin were dead.\u201d She spent three days at home, in a daze, too ashamed to step outside. Then, in an extraordinary act of bravery, she says she confronted the Russian soldier\u2019s commander. \u201cHis commander found the head of his unit. He came to see me and told me, \u2018I punished him severely, I broke his jaw, but the most severe punishment is ahead.\u2019 Like shooting. The commander asked me, \u2018Do you mind this?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t mind, I wish all of them will be shot.\u2019\u201d Although the prosecutor, Kleshchenko, and police officer Oleksandr Svidro are looking specifically for evidence of sexual crimes, everywhere they go they are confronted with the horrors of occupation. In these liberated villages, nearly every building has been damaged by war. Many homes were reduced to rubble. At their first stop on the day CNN accompanied the investigators, in Bila Krynytsya, a crowd waiting for food handouts surrounded the prosecutor. The village was behind Russian lines, but never directly occupied. Those gathered round shout that they\u2019ve been abandoned for months, with no help from either Russia or Ukraine. \u201cDid you report [the damage] to anyone?\u201d the prosecutor asks. \u201cWho would we report it to?\u201d replies a man in the crowd. A man in the crowd tells the investigators that he was held by Russian soldiers and subjected to mock execution. It\u2019s hard to hear, tales of torture like this are common here, but that\u2019s not the subject of their work today. Despite the dissatisfaction of these villagers, Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive in this part of the country has buoyed public hopes that victory might actually be possible \u2013 or at least that Kyiv might liberate key Russian-held cities, such as Kherson. Starting slowly at the end of the summer, and then in large measure at the beginning of October, Ukrainian forces have regained hundreds of square miles of territory that Russia held since the early days of its full-scale invasion. A short drive down roads pockmarked by shelling, in Tverdomedove, a mother and daughter tell Kleshchenko that they have not heard of any sexual crimes in their one-road hamlet. Their neighbor, 71-year-old Vera Lapushnyak, sobs uncontrollably. The Russians were kind when they first arrived, she says. \u201cThey said they came to protect us,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut from whom, why \u2013 we didn\u2019t know.\u201d She was widowed more than 30 years ago \u2013 she says her husband died in a motorcycle accident \u2013 and her son joined the military soon after Russia\u2019s invasion on February 24. She decided to leave, she says, about three months after Russian troops occupied her village. Months later, after the Ukrainian military liberated her village in a lightning counteroffensive, she returned. Shelling had reduced her roof to its rafters. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to sleep now,\u201d she says, in tears. \u201cThere are no windows or doors. I sleep like a bum.\u201d She shows us inside. The ceiling of her bedroom has completely collapsed. She\u2019s moved her bed to the only room that still has an intact window. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to put it so that (the ceiling) won\u2019t fall on my head,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it would fall and kill me that would be better, so I won\u2019t suffer. But I want to see my son again.\u201d As the sun sets at the end of a long day, the two-man team arrives in Novovoznesens\u2019ke, a village where they\u2019ve uncovered two more cases of rape, allegedly by Russian soldiers. The next day, they return to Kyiv, to submit their findings. Of course, many of these allegations will be impossible to prove; many do not even have a suspect. For now, the team files its reports, and its investigators continue their work, hoping to be able to file charges in the future. The United Nations says it has investigated cases in Ukraine of \u201csexual and gender-based violence\u201d against people ranging from 4 to 82 years old. As of September, 43 criminal proceedings had been initiated , according to the UN. The police officer, Svidro, says most cases of sexual violence go entirely unreported. The work takes its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s psychologically difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cYou understand every person is distressed.

They had a prediction after Tuesday night's loss: Their son was going to throw a no-hitter. \"Yeah, they told me last night,\" Javier said after the Astros did just that: combine for a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies to tie the series at two apiece with their 5-0 victory.

The young right-hander had six no-hit innings going through 97 pitches, but manager Dusty Baker had seen this story play out before. It was on June 25 when Javier got the ball against the Yankees in the Bronx, and he lit up the stat sheet with 13 strikeouts and no hits through seven innings. The Astros\u2019 bullpen would keep his no-hitter alive and combine for it when all was said and done in the 3-0 win. Baker did the same thing this time around, pulling Javier instead of letting him go for history. Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and closer Ryan Pressly shut down the Phillies\u2019 lineup to stamp their place in MLB history, as third baseman Alex Bregman scooped up a short hop off the bat of J.T.

(Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) Baker may not have said it directly, but the decision to remove Javier appeared to be based off how green he is in MLB and how late in the year it is to be pitching. \"We had a fresh bullpen, our guys are throwing good down there, and we figured that that was enough, especially this late in the year,\" Baker said. \"We had him around 100, we didn\u2019t want to start him in that next inning.

I\u2019m like \u2018there\u2019s no such thing.\u2019 But I guess so,\" Baker said, as he watched Javier throw 70 fastballs of his 97 pitches. \"This guy\u2019s been doing it for us all year. It\u2019s ironic that Cristian was pitching to Christian. We needed this game tonight to tie up the series. \"This guy made the team during that COVID year, 2020. We thought we knew what we had, but we really didn\u2019t. His control was a little off at the time.

The cuts in Asia Pacific will be greater than the bank\u2019s annual staff losses from natural attrition in the region, the three sources said, adding that a final decision on the size of the cuts is yet to be taken. Global cuts will be made around the same time, they added. A fourth source said the bank has yet to make decisions about the scale or timing of any layoffs, adding that layoffs are not imminent. Any cuts would represent a low-single digit percentage of staff globally, this person said. Morgan Stanley, which had 81,567 employees globally at the end of the third quarter, according to a company filing, declined to comment for the story.

The Justice Department has arrested 21 people suspected of belonging to a theft ring that made millions of dollars from stolen catalytic converters, the car parts that have increasingly become targets across the country. A team of law enforcement agencies at the local, state and federal levels seized hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, such as homes, bank accounts and cash, cars and jewelry from the defendants.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days\u2019 worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. Russian strikes were also reported in Kriviy Rih, in central Ukraine, and in Sumy and Kharkiv, in the northeast. Heavy fighting was ongoing in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. \u201cThe enemy is trying to keep the temporarily captured territories, concentrating its efforts on restraining the actions of the Defence Forces in certain areas,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s general staff said on Thursday. Russia has said it targeted infrastructure as part of what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to degrade the Ukrainian military and remove what it says is a potential threat against Russia\u2019s security. As a result, Ukrainian civilians have endured power cuts and reduced water supplies in recent weeks. Russia denies targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and left some Ukrainian cities in ruins. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich democracies will discuss how best to coordinate further support for Ukraine when they meet on Thursday in Germany following recent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The attacks come after Russia said it would resume its participation in a deal freeing up grain exports from Ukraine, reversing a decision that world leaders warned would increase hunger globally. Russia, whose forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, announced the reversal on Wednesday after Turkey and the United Nations helped keep Ukrainian grain flowing for several days without a Russian role in inspections. The defence ministry justified the resumption by saying it had received guarantees from Ukraine that it would not use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. \u201cThe Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was important to stand up to \u201ccrazy Russian aggression that destabilises international trade\u201d. \u201cAfter eight months of Russia\u2019s so-called special operation, the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said in his nightly video address. \u201cThis is truly a remarkable statement. It shows just what a failure the Russian aggression has been and just how strong we all are when we maintain our unity.\u201d The grain deal, originally reached three months ago, had helped alleviate a global food crisis by lifting a de facto Russian blockade on Ukraine, one of the world\u2019s biggest grain suppliers. The prospect of it collapsing this week revived fears of a worsening food crisis and rising prices. The prices of wheat, soybeans, corn and rapeseed fell sharply on global markets after Russia\u2019s announcement. Zelensky credited Turkey and the United Nations for making it possible for ships to continue moving out of Ukrainian ports with cargoes after Russia suspended participation on Saturday. Russia suspended its involvement in the deal saying it could not guarantee safety for civilian ships crossing the Black Sea after an attack on its fleet. Ukraine and Western countries called that a false pretext for \u201cblackmail\u201d, using threats to the global food supply. In the south, a Ukrainian counter-offensive has left Russian forces fighting to hold their ground around the city of Kherson, where Russian-installed authorities are urging residents to evacuate, the Ukrainian military said. Residents who had collaborated with occupying forces were leaving and some departing medical staff had taken equipment from hospitals, it said. Residents of the town of Nova Zburivka had been given three days to leave and were told that evacuation would be obligatory from Nov. 5. Russian authorities have repeatedly said Ukraine could be preparing to attack the massive Kakhovka dam, upriver on the Dnipro, and flood the region. Kyiv denies that. \u201cObviously, we are afraid of this. That is why we are leaving,\u201d resident Pavel Ryazskiy, who was evacuated to Crimea, said of the possibility the dam could be destroyed.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The politics of education have changed so much, so quickly in the COVID-19 era that universal school choice -- an unattainable ideal for generations of reformers -- has suddenly become a middle-of-the-road position for most Americans. Universal education choice should be a ripe campaign issue for state candidates this fall and the top policy priority for newly elected state legislatures in the new year. The watchword is very simple: trust parents, not bureaucracies; and fund students, not systems. It\u2019s not just a slogan. In Arizona, it\u2019s now policy. Thanks to legislation signed by Gov. Doug Ducey this summer, from now on, instead of sending dollars to school districts, every student in the state will receive $7,000 in an Education Savings Account to use at any school or for any educational approach, every year, from kindergarten through high school. There is no reason other states -- Texas, in particular -- should not follow suit. The Lone Star State is surrounded by neighbors that have embraced education choice: Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. And let\u2019s be frank: because of its size and influence, Texas achieving universal school choice would create even greater momentum for passing similar legislation in other states. Video Gov. Greg Abbott and the 88th Texas legislature are perfectly positioned to earn a mandate for enacting universal statewide education choice, and then to lead a state-by-state movement to make parental empowerment and ESAs the new standard of reform nationwide. And not far away in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to support expansions of the state\u2019s education savings account, voucher, and tax credit scholarship programs, which are enabling nearly 200,000 students to select a learning environment that fits their needs. A February poll by RealClear Opinion Research found that 72 percent of Americans (including 68 percent of Democrats) support school choice, while only 18 percent oppose. A majority of Americans now rate public schools as unsatisfactory, and some 1.2 million schoolchildren have transferred out of them since the beginning of the pandemic. Arizona, a purple state with two Democrat senators and a blue congressional delegation -- just created the nation\u2019s first universal school choice program: an education savings account option open for every single Arizona family. These trends may surprise political insiders who accept the media\u2019s framing of school choice as a controversial idea. But they shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not just that most Americans support school choice; between private and magnet schools, charters, homeschooling, and parents who chose their residence for the school district, most American families already exercise some kind of school choice. Video This School Choice Moment is the silver lining of the left\u2019s disastrous mismanagement of American schools since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The teachers' unions, elected progressives, and media elites who long styled themselves as defenders of public education now brazenly debase it: closing schools, masking and indoctrinating students in defiance of scientific and historical fact, conspiring against parental authority, even covering up crimes and siccing the FBI on moms and dads who objected. And lest anyone forget, America\u2019s K-12 schools were in crisis before COVID-19. The vast majority of students perform below grade-level proficiency in reading, writing, civics, history, and math. That was the case pre-pandemic, and it continues today. Boys, in particular, have fallen so far behind that U.S. classrooms are no longer equal opportunity environments. The \"Great Awokening\" and COVID-theater school closures only slathered racist, homophobic, anti-family sociopathy, and anti-scientific superstition onto an already dysfunctional system desperate for reform. The good news is that however far Left the education establishment has lurched since 2020 -- \"Math is racist! Kindergartners are trans! Parents are idiots! America is evil! And oh by the way, we\u2019re still going remote, suckers!\" -- the Overton Window has shifted just as far in the opposite direction. Video In education today, it\u2019s the status quo that is harmful and divisive; school choice is the non-partisan compromise. Conservatives have never had an opportunity like this on the education issue before. Come to think of it, conservatives haven\u2019t had an opportunity like this on any issue, ever. We have to seize it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Nor is there any reason for conservative reformers to aim lower. We both support measures to protect students from the racist ideas of critical race theory in classrooms, protect girls\u2019 sports, and the like. But conservatives should not miss the forest for the trees. Universal education choice would do more to combat woke indoctrination and student endangerment than all those targeted reforms put together. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is not often that politics and policy line up so neatly, especially for conservatives. But right now, the question Americans are asking is not whether parental choice in education is a good idea, but instead how it should be implemented. Answering that question is how the right can craft a successful and popular governing agenda for years to come. Brooke Rollins is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute.

(FOX) So it goes, as the sole owner of the influential social media platform tries to figure out how to pay the bills, having reluctantly forked over $44 billion in a deal leaving Twitter with a heavy debt load. The erratic innovator has made mistakes, including tweeting a link to a false and despicable conspiracy theory about the attack on Paul Pelosi that he soon deleted while offering no apology. And with his belated embrace of content moderation, the man who championed free speech is reminding some people of that old The Who song: \"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\" But Musk, now running Twitter as a private company as he weighs sweeping layoffs, is hardly the same as the previous management. In a flurry of tweets, Musk said \"Twitter\u2019s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn\u2019t have a blue checkmark is bull****.\" For a mere monthly fee of $8, he says, folks will get priority in searches and mentions, and the ability to post long videos. AND IF YOU ACT NOW, you\u2019ll get half as many ads. This could be seen as pay to play, allowing affluent users to buy greater prominence on Twitter. But Musk has to do something to bring in cash. He says this will help reduce spam accounts and create a fund to \"reward\" content creators, the most active of whom are key to Twitter\u2019s success. \"Essentially,\" Elon says, \"this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude. Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!\" Separately, the Washington Post reports Twitter is a week or two away from launching something called Paywalled Video, which users could see only by clicking a box that requires them to pay anywhere between $1 and $10, but an internal email says this is a high-risk venture because of copyright issues and legal compliance.

What\u2019s equally interesting is how much New Twitter will regulate content on the app compared to Old Twitter.

And Wednesday night, he delivered a gem -- just when his team needed it most.", "content": "PHILADELPHIA -- Late last week, before Cristian Javier etched his name into baseball history, his Houston Astros teammates attempted to describe his fastball. By velocity alone, it is a milquetoast effort, flung from his right arm at 94 mph. And yet one teammate called the pitch \"obscene\" and another said \"it looks 100\" and a third deemed it \"invisible.\" On Wednesday night, after Javier started Game 4 of the World Series, one more teammate chimed in with the most apt descriptor of all. \"Clearly unhittable,\" Astros closer Ryan Pressly said. Certain pitches in baseball are so good they anger hitters, aggravate and frustrate and confound. Javier's fastball tops the list. He threw invisiball after invisiball Wednesday, carving through a Philadelphia Phillies lineup with six no-hit innings that set the stage for Pressly to close out the first ever combined no-hitter in the World Series; the Fall Classic's first hitless effort since Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956. Houston's 5-0 victory evened the World Series at two games apiece and continued the 25-year-old Javier's meteoric rise from sometimes-starter, sometimes-reliever to the most dominant pitcher this postseason. It's a reputation that Javier solidified over 11\u2153 innings in the playoffs' last two rounds, with Javier allowing one hit and no runs and racking up 14 strikeouts against the potent offenses of the New York Yankees and Phillies. In a World Series that has featured starts by Justin Verlander, Framber Valdez, Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler, Javier has twirled the best game of the bunch. Javier finds himself here because of that fastball, a pitch that combines a number of important attributes to make it a wholly unique pitch -- \"a unicorn,\" said one scout, who called Javier's fastball the best in all of baseball, an assessment with which others concur. The secret sauce for Javier's fastball starts with something called vertical approach angle (VAA). It is essentially the pitcher's equivalent of launch angle, measuring the angle at which a fastball goes toward the plate. Pitchers with extremely high arm slots have high VAAs, and ones like Javier, with lower arm angles, come with low VAAs. What's exceptional about Javier isn't just a VAA that is third lowest among starters, behind Freddy Peralta and Joe Ryan, two other pitchers whose fastballs play way above their velocities. His high front side adds some funk and deception to the delivery. His spin rate and spin efficiency are well above average. VAA is an important factor -- \"a big component of it [with Javier] is the approach angle, we think,\" Astros pitching coach Josh Miller said -- but the other elements help give the pitch what looks like a rising effect. Physics, of course, prevent a fastball from actually rising. With Javier's VAA and spin characteristics, his fastball simply drops less than the average one. And because nobody else throws like him, hitters trying to track the pitch struggle because of how it carries through the strike zone and looks as if it's hopping as it crosses the plate. \"That's just an absolute kangaroo of a fastball coming from his hip,\" Astros reliever Ryne Stanek said. \"And he's got some of the longest arms I've ever seen. His fastball is obscene.\" \"Doesn't matter what the radar gun's saying,\" fellow reliever Hector Neris said. \"It may say he's 94, but the heater looks 100. It's gas.\" That deception explains why, one day after hitting five home runs off Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. amid concerns that he might have tipped his pitches, the Phillies couldn't see anything against Javier -- or the three relievers that followed him, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Pressly. Ten days after his last start, against the Yankees, Javier threw 97 pitches, 70 of which were fastballs. He struck out nine, including a five-batter stretch in which he got J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos swinging before catching Alec Bohm and Bryson Stott looking, all on fastballs. \"His nickname is El Reptil because he's just cold-blooded,\" Stanek said. \"Nothing fazes him. He could give up a pump, same face. Punch the side three innings in a row, same face. He's just that guy. What he does is special.\" The Astros knew that already. They'd seen Javier sashay into Yankee Stadium on June 25 and throw seven no-hit innings with 13 strikeouts, paving the way for Neris and Pressly to finish what wound up as only their first combined no-hitter of the season. This one was bigger, better, far more important in ensuring the Astros would return home for a Game 6 and have a chance to clinch a championship at Minute Maid Park. Pitching in Game 4 in front of his father, Cecilio, who had never seen Javier pitch in the big leagues before only added to the majesty of the night. Javier was already an unlikely success story: a failed outfielder who converted to pitcher, signed at 18 years old out of the Dominican Republic for $10,000, figured out how to harness his unicorn and rode it not just to the big leagues but to the sort of praise that hitters lavish infrequently. \"It's electric,\" said Christian Vazquez, who caught the no-hitter. \"It's like playing PlayStation with him. You don't care if it's going down and away. It's going to finish up.\" Astros players brave enough to step into the batter's box against Javier understand how he finished this season with a 2.54 ERA and remains unscored upon as a starter since Sept. 7. In his final four starts of the regular season, Javier threw 23 scoreless innings, allowed six hits and struck out 29. \"I did play catch with him a couple spring trainings ago, and it just really gets on you,\" said Hunter Brown, another member of the Astros' dynamic bullpen. \"It's just kind of invisible. I remember the first couple -- you always wanna catch it in the seat. First couple hit me kind of in the pink area. I'm like, OK, I better figure that one out.\" In 2020, Javier's rookie season, third baseman Alex Bregman faced Javier in a live at-bat on a shadowy day at Minute Maid Park during MLB's accelerated spring camp. Bregman stared at strike one, strike two, strike three, not even lifting the bat off his shoulder. He walked back to the dugout, put his lumber in the bat rack and said: \"I'm glad he's on our team.\" Opponents wish the same. They'll say so to Bregman at third base -- if they can get there -- and wonder how a pitch sitting 94 can look triple digits or how from his low slot he can generate such true spin or how they keep swinging over that stupid fastball. \"A lot of people are like, 'Wow, it's just insane stuff,'\" Bregman said. \"And they'll say it's insane how the ball looks coming out of his hand.\" So, OK, this magic pitch, this miracle fastball, this World Series no-hitter-causing bit of sorcery: What does it look like coming out of his hand? \"I don't know,\" Bregman said. \"I didn't see it.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-17.196916580200195, -21.259979248046875]}, {"title": "Astros' Javier, relievers no-hit Phillies, even series", "link": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34936784/javier-bullpen-combine-no-hitter-astros-tie-series?device=featurephone", "description": "Houston starter Cristian Javier was masterful in Philadelphia Wednesday night, tossing six hitless innings before giving way to the Astros bullpen to finish a no-hitter over the Phillies in a 5-0 victory in Game 4 of the World Series.", "content": "PHILADELPHIA -- Cristian Javier's parents, Trinidad Mieses and Cecilio Javier, flew from the Dominican Republic to Philadelphia and sat in his hotel room late Tuesday night, in the buildup to the biggest outing of his life. The Houston Astros were coming off a difficult loss and needed Javier to rescue them from an overwhelming World Series deficit, but Trinidad and Cecilio attempted to strike an optimistic, supportive tone. They proved to be prophetic. \"Let's try to stay positive,\" Javier recalled hearing from his mother and father. \"God willing, you'll throw a no-hitter.\" Less than 24 hours later, Javier teamed with Astros relievers Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly in completing the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, using his devastating fastball to vex a helpless Philadelphia Phillies lineup through the first six innings of what became a 5-0 Astros victory in Game 4 on Wednesday. The win tied the Series at two games apiece and placed Javier in exceedingly rare company, joining former New York Yankees right-hander Don Larsen -- author of a perfect game in 1956 -- as the only pitchers in World Series history to finish an outing with no hits allowed in six or more innings. \"This is the best gift I could have ever given my family, my parents,\" Javier said in Spanish. \"To me, it's even more special knowing that they were able to see that in person.\" Javier's start was a reenactment of the combined no-hitter he played a key role in against the Yankees on June 25, making Javier the first pitcher to start multiple combined no-hitters within a career, let alone the same season. He set the tone for what became the third no-hitter of any kind in the 119 years that Major League Baseball has staged the postseason, and the second -- along with Roy Halladay's in the 2010 National League Division Series, against a Cincinnati Reds team managed by current Astros manager Dusty Baker -- that took place at Citizens Bank Park. \"That's what's strange about life,\" Baker said of finally getting on the right side of a postseason no-hitter. \"I remember being on the other end of that. It was the seventh inning and it seemed like it was the second inning, and I looked up on the board and it's the seventh inning already. Then you're trying not to be no-hit and then you're trying to win the ballgame and -- yeah, that's pretty remarkable.\" Javier himself is remarkable. He was signed for $10,000 seven years ago from La Victoria, a small town within Santo Domingo known mostly for the notorious prison that shares its name. He was nearing his 18th birthday then, old in an international market where prospects agree to deals at 12 and 13 years old, and he threw only in the mid-80s. But his fastball was already extremely difficult to hit. As he got stronger, his velocity continued to increase. He became the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year in 2019, established himself as a dynamic weapon -- in the rotation or out of the bullpen -- in 2020 and 2021, and reached a new level in 2022, posting a 2.54 ERA in 148\u2154 regular-season innings. As the year went on, Javier only got better. Dating back to Sept. 14, the 25-year-old right-hander has thrown at least five scoreless innings and allowed no more than two hits in six consecutive starts. He is now the first pitcher in postseason history with at least five innings and no more than one hit allowed in back-to-back starts. \"Just going into today's game, we had so much confidence in him,\" Astros center fielder Chas McCormick said. \"Even coaches, I had a feeling -- Javier's gonna shove today. And he's been shoving.\" Javier struck out nine batters and issued just two walks through the first six innings. At the start of the fourth, he began a stretch of five consecutive strikeouts. In the sixth, the pitcher with the lowest groundball rate in the majors during the regular season -- among those who compiled at least 140 innings -- benefitted from three consecutive groundouts. At that point, Javier became the first pitcher to reach six no-hit innings in the World Series since Jerry Koosman in 1969. Javier did it, of course, with his four-seam fastball. He threw it 72% of the time, the highest percentage of his major league career, and recorded 14 of his 18 outs -- including two-thirds of his strikeouts -- with that pitch. He also got 27 foul balls off it, the most of any pitcher on a singular pitch in a game this season, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. It was a sign that the Phillies were consistently late, the main characteristic Astros co-pitching coach Joshua Miller looks for in Javier. \"It's a good fastball,\" Phillies left fielder Kyle Schwarber said. \"He's got good extension, good ride, things like that. When it says '92' up on the board, it's playing a little bit harder than that.\" The Astros let Javier extend all the way to 115 pitches while recording the first 21 outs of the combined no-hitter at Yankee Stadium in late June. A little more than four months later, he was pulled after throwing 97 pitches through 18 outs, in part, Miller said, so they could potentially use him out of the bullpen later in this series. By that point, the Astros' offense had already scored five runs -- all in the fifth, when Jose Alvarado inherited a bases-loaded, none-out situation and proceeded to plunk Yordan Alvarez, then give up a two-run double to Alex Bregman, a sacrifice fly to Kyle Tucker and a run-scoring single to Yuli Gurriel. Abreu entered in the bottom of the seventh and struck out the side despite facing the heart of the Phillies' order. He said he had no idea that he had inherited a no-hitter in progress. He found out an inning later, when he was in the clubhouse and heard his teammates get really animated as Montero took the ball for the eighth inning. \"I was shocked,\" Abreu said in Spanish. Montero followed suit by retiring all three batters, the last on a 99 mph Jean Segura line drive hit directly at Astros right fielder Tucker -- a batted ball that came with an expected batting average of .910. Pressly, the Astros' dominant closer, then finished it off in the ninth, just like he did in late June, this time working around a walk to record three outs on a Brandon Marsh strikeout, a Rhys Hoskins flyout and, lastly, a J.T. Realmuto groundout. \"You get slapped in the face yesterday and go back today and make a statement,\" said Pressly, who watched the Phillies crank out five home runs against Lance McCullers Jr. in the Game 3 loss. \"You try to have the mind of the goldfish in this game. You try not to think about anything. You just want to go out there and try to produce and put a 'W' in the column.\" There have been 18 combined no-hitters throughout major league history, but none have come particularly close to occurring in the postseason. The only other one that extended through seven innings was done by the Atlanta Braves, against these Astros, in Game 3 of last year's World Series. Javier, Abreu, Montero, Pressly and Astros catcher Christian Vazquez, who filled in for Martin Maldonado largely because of how well he works with Javier, all posed with the baseball on the field postgame. The National Baseball Hall of Fame preserved one of the baseballs Javier pitched with and got it signed by all five players, also keeping a rosin bag and John Smoltz's scoresheet. \"It's a very special day for us,\" Vazquez said. It was even more special for Javier because of who attended. His mother, Trinidad, has been able to see him a handful of times, but Wednesday marked the first time his father, Cecilio, has been able to take in one of his major league games in person. Their prediction ultimately helped. \"I knew I had a very important start in front of me,\" Javier said. \"When they told me [that I was going to throw a no-hitter], it gave me faith.\"", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-16.040922164916992, -21.746715545654297]}, {"title": "Massage therapist testifies she first told Mel Gibson she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/massage-therapist-testifies-first-told-mel-gibson-sexually-assaulted-harvey-weinstein", "description": "A massage therapist said in court on Wednesday that Harvey Weinstein had sexually assaulted her and masturbated in front of her multiple times when he was her client.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash Top Entertainment Headlines Nov. 2 Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.

Just four months later, Pressly became the first pitcher in MLB history to take part in two combined no-hitters, as he closed out Wednesday\u2019s 5-0 no-hit win by the Astros over the Phillies in Game 4 of the World Series at Citizens Bank Park to tie the series at 2-2. \u201cThere\u2019s always pressure in the World Series,\u2019\u2019 Pressly said after Wednesday\u2019s win. \u201cRegardless of what the score is, you want to put up a zero.

But, as Baker said after the victory, \u201cIt\u2019s baseball in 2022.\u201d So when Javier was at 97 pitches through six innings, there wasn\u2019t much of a decision to be made \u2014 especially considering who Baker had to bring in behind Javier. \u201cWe had a real fresh bullpen, [an] extremely fresh bullpen, and one of the best bullpens around,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSo I had full faith that they could do the job.\u201d He was right. Baker first turned to Bryan Abreu, who had arguably the toughest task of any of the three relievers used, facing the heart of Philadelphia\u2019s lineup. But the right-hander entered and whiffed J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos in his one inning of work. Abreu said there was no talk of the no-hitter in the bullpen before he entered. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at the box score,\u2019\u2019 Abreu said.

Pressly entered in the ninth and the closer was the only reliever to allow a base runner, when he walked Kyle Schwarber with one out before getting Rhys Hoskins to pop to right and Realmuto to hit a chopper to third, where Alex Bregman made a nice play to end it. \u201cAs soon as I saw [Bregman] scoop it, I knew it was over,\u2019\u2019 Pressly said. \u201cWe were able to put the [Game 3] loss behind us and now we have to keep this going into [Thursday].\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-16.700788497924805, -20.783769607543945]}, {"title": "No-hitter thrown for just the second time in World Series history as Astros beat Phillies in Game 4", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/sport/astros-phillies-no-hitter-game-4-world-series-spt/index.html", "description": "For just the second time in World Series history, a no-hitter has been thrown as four Houston Astros pitchers completed the feat against the Philadelphia Phillies Wednesday night to win 5-0 and secure their place in baseball lore.", "content": "For just the second time in World Series history, a no-hitter has been thrown as four Houston Astros pitchers completed the feat against the Philadelphia Phillies Wednesday night to win 5-0 and secure their place in baseball lore.

The U.S. on Wednesday accused North Korea of secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells, and reports over the past month detailed how Iran first supplied Russia with Shahed-136 \"kamikaze\" drones and then trained Russian troops in their use. New reports indicate that Iran added Mohajer-6 as well as Shahed-129 drones to its shipments.

Russia had already drawn in Chechen fighters in the early phase of the Ukraine war after it became clear the conflict would not end as soon as Putin had believed and would require more commitment.

As Election Day nears and the nation prepares to head to the polls, it's still unclear which party has the best chance to win control of the Senate . But four volatile races in different regions of the country will likely determine the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans. The Senate races in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania are ground zero in the battle for Congress' upper chamber, with polling averages showing no clear advantage for either Republicans or Democrats, and the candidates in each race are clamoring to be the win that brings their respective party over the 50-seat threshold for a majority. In Georgia, Republican Herschel Walker leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock by 1.6%, according to the Real Clear Politics (RCP) average of polls taken in recent weeks, well within the margin of error. As in many races with a Democratic incumbent in a year predicted to be favorable for Republicans, Walker trailed Warnock by a larger percentage earlier in the summer but has since closed that gap despite attempts by Democrats to paint him as extreme and not a serious candidate.

Raphael Warnock (Republican National Convention/Handout via Reuters | Tom Williams/Pool via Reuters) Republican Blake Masters in Arizona has made similar strides. While he still trails incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly by 2.3%, according to RCP , that lead is much narrower than the nearly 10-point lead Kelly held in September. In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt, the state's former attorney general, leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by 1.9%, according to RCP , with much of his boost in support appearing to come from independent voters in the traditional battleground state. He has maintained his lead in the polling average since overtaking Cortez Masto in September despite the latter being viewed more favorably among voters. \u2018IMPULSE TO CONCEAL\u2019: JOHN FETTERMAN LOSES OUT ON MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN HEATED SENATE RACE In arguably the most high-profile race this year, Democratic Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman holds a slight 0.6% lead over Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz, according to RCP , one of the closest margins in the race since the primary elections. The gap between the two closed following continued concerns over Fetterman's health after he suffered a stroke earlier this year and his refusal to release his medical records. His performance in the only debate between the two candidates last week received widespread criticism due to what appeared to be his trouble speaking and processing information throughout the event.

Ted Budd and Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina, and incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin. HOUSE DIVIDED: DEMOCRATS TURN ON PARTY LEADERSHIP AS MIDTERM HOPES FADE DESPITE SUPPORTIVE VOTING RECORDS Republicans are favored in each of those races but have been prime targets for Democrats throughout this election cycle. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote giving Democrats the slimmest possible majority. Assuming Republicans win the races in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin, as well as every other race they are heavily favored to win, they would need to win two of the four critical toss-up seats to gain control of the Senate or one of the four seats to maintain the 50-50 split.

The actions by the federal agencies come as Missouri and Louisiana are pursuing legal action against Biden, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top administration officials. The two states say these officials \"pressured and colluded\" with Big Tech social media companies to censor and suppress information on the Hunter Biden laptop story, COVID-19 origins and security of voting by mail during the pandemic. Despite the ongoing lawsuit and vocal criticism by members of Congress, Biden's agencies remain focused on countering disinformation from foreign adversaries attempting to influence U.S. elections and on certain topics, including COVID-19 origins, the deadly Afghanistan withdrawal and more. DISINFORMATION PUSH SHOWS DHS \u2018POLITICIZING\u2019 ITSELF, SAY TOP HOMELAND SECURITY REPUBLICANS Homeland Security New documents first reported by The Intercept on Monday revealed that while the Department of Homeland Security disbanded its controversial Disinformation Governance Board in May, the agency is still working to combat disinformation on a range of topics, including COVID-19, vaccines, racial issues, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Ukraine aid. DHS came under scrutiny for its \"un-American\" board, which critics on the left and right called an effort to chill the right to free speech. As a result, DHS terminated the board in late May. Biden administration agencies are pushing campaigns to combat disinformation. Now, Republicans are sounding the alarm about how DHS may still be working with Big Tech to combat disinformation on social media. \"Reports of DHS\u2019s involvement in efforts to be the arbiter of truth on wide-ranging topics are extremely concerning,\" said Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., who serves as the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, in a statement. \"The American People do not approve of the Department engaging in unclear, unaccountable, and opaque efforts led by the Biden administration\u2019s ever-changing definition of \u2018truth,'\" House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, added in a tweet: \"If DHS is planning to investigate disinformation regarding the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, they should begin by looking within the Biden administration.\" However, the agency maintains that \"disinformation\" is a national security threat that must be addressed. \"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is charged with safeguarding the United States against threats to its security, including threats exacerbated by disinformation,\" DHS said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \"When it comes to DHS\u2019s work, the Department is focused on disinformation that threatens the security of the American people, including disinformation spread by foreign states such as Russia, China, and Iran, or other adversaries such as transnational criminal organizations and human smuggling organizations. Such malicious actors often spread disinformation to exploit vulnerable individuals and the American public, including during national emergencies,\" the DHS spokesperson continued. DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which was formed under former President Trump, is also closely involved in the agency's disinformation efforts and has ramped up efforts to provide \"truthful\" information about conspiracy theories and misinformation on election integrity, among other issues. Concerns by critics stem from the fact that the Biden administration has repeatedly stated that White supremacists are the greatest threats to the nation and has enacted a new domestic terrorism strategy. \"The U.S. Government will also work to find ways to counter the polarization often fueled by disinformation, misinformation, and dangerous conspiracy theories online, supporting an information environment that fosters healthy democratic discourse,\" the White House announcement from June 2021 stated. Justice and FBI The Justice Department, over several years and several administrations, has been steadily prosecuting disinformation campaigns backed by malign actors, particularly Russia and Iran, which use social media to spew false or dishonest narratives. Under the Biden administration, the department charged two Iranian nationals in 2021 for a \"cyber-enabled disinformation and threat campaign\" aimed at targeting the 2020 election. Testimony by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey before the House Judiciary Committee in 2019 drew attention to the department's ongoing efforts to fight \"malign foreign influence operations\" aimed at spreading misinformation. \"Malign foreign influence operations aimed at the United States are not a new problem. \u2026 Although the tactics have evolved, the goals of these activities remain the same: to spread disinformation and to sow discord on a mass scale in order to weaken the U.S. democratic process, and ultimately to undermine the appeal of democracy itself,\" said Hickey. Attorney General Merrick Garland (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) The FBI has focused on foreign influence in elections, in particular though its Foreign Influence Task Force, even though it does not have an official \"disinformation\" policy. Senior FBI officials told Fox News Digital the task force is the \"primary entity\" inside the FBI focused on \"foreign malign influence targeting elections.\" \" The FBI does not investigate First Amendment protected activities,\" an FBI spokesperson told Fox News Digital Wednesday. \"The FBI does not and will not police speech or ideology, and we do not investigate misinformation or disinformation unless there is an explicit violation of federal law, such as a threat of violence. The FBI is responsible for investigating foreign influence operations intended to undermine American democratic processes and institutions. We focus on activities attributed to foreign actors, not on the content or narrative,\" the spokesperson continued. However, the DOJ and FBI have come under fire for allegedly suppressing information on Hunter Biden's laptop ahead of the 2020 election under the guise of \"misinformation.\" The top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has pressed the agencies for an explanation about why they pursued \"politically charged investigations\" related to the Trump campaign while suppressing key details related to the Hunter Biden probe as \"disinformation\" in light of new whistleblower information. In addition, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and a handful of Republican senators are demanding access to all communications between DOJ and the American Medical Association, which recently asked the attorney general to investigate and prosecute alleged \"disinformation campaigns\" against gender-altering surgeries for minors . DOJ has not commented on the AMA's request or the inquiry led by Republicans into the matter. REPUBLICANS SLAM DHS' ONGOING CRACKDOWN ON 'DISINFORMATION' AFTER DISBANDING CONTROVERSIAL GOVERNANCE BOARD Heath and Human Services The U.S. surgeon general released a memo in 2020 on \"Confronting Health Misinformation\" that was aimed at \"building a healthy information environment\" amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I am urging all Americans to help slow the spread of health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health. It can cause confusion, sow mistrust, harm people\u2019s health, and undermine public health efforts. Limiting the spread of health misinformation is a moral and civic imperative that will require a whole-of-society effort,\" wrote Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra (Shawn Thew/Pool via AP, File) The memo included a section titled, \"What Technology Platforms Can Do,\" including making \"meaningful long-term investments to address misinformation, including product changes.\" It recommended changes to \"avoid amplifying misinformation\" and building in \"frictions\" like suggestions and warnings that would \"reduce the sharing of misinformation, and make it easier for users to report misinformation.\" MAYORKAS ADMITS HE \u2018COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB\u2019 EXPLAINING MISSION OF \u2018DISINFORMATION\u2019 BOARD In addition, HHS is handing out $1 million in grant funding for research into how \"vaccine misinformation\" found on social media can affect people's confidence in vaccines. HHS announced the grant opportunity, \"Developing a Public Health Tool to Predict the Virality of Vaccine Misinformation Narratives,\" last month and will send the funds to a single applicant next year. The awardee will use the funds to develop a forecasting model that aims to identify potential misinformation on vaccines and how it will affect people as it spreads on social media. Defense The Pentagon enacted a new policy on Aug. 12, 2022, titled, \"Official Use of Social Media for Public Affairs Purposes,\" warning against adversaries who may try and distort the truth or mislead employees through \"disinformation campaigns.\" \"Users, malign actors, and adversaries on social media platforms may attempt to impersonate DOD employees and Service members to disrupt online activity, distract audiences from official accounts, discredit DOD information, or manipulate audiences through disinformation campaigns,\" that policy said. The August memo is the first time the Pentagon put out a department-wide policy pertaining to the use of social media for employees. State Department Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during remarks at Stanford last month, called combating disinformation \"a big focus\" of the agency and praised the university and other private-sector partners and social media platforms for working with him on this effort. \"And one of the things we have to do is to make sure that we\u2019re using technology itself to deal with some of the downsides of technology when it\u2019s misused, including when it comes to misinformation and disinformation.

She was 26. The woman allegedly behind the wheel of a car that caused a crash that killed Hoy and seriously injured three other people, including her twin, has been identified. Carlie Eileen Richards, 38, on Wednesday was subject to a bedside hearing from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide following the fatal crash. Richards was deemed too mentally unwell to attend court in person, and according to The Advertiser , did not speak during the hearing. Magistrate Paul Bennett was asked by her duty solicitor, Tyson Leung, for Richards to be detained under section 269x of the criminal law act, the publication reported. The form was typically requested in cases where a defendant\u2019s mental competence was in question. Leung told the court it was likely the order would pre-empt a bail application in two weeks. Police alleged in court Richards\u2019 dangerous driving caused the death of Hoy and the serious injury of her twin sister Lisa, boyfriend Mike Reader, 29, and another driver, Klio Bruckner. It was also alleged by police that Richards tried to flee the scene of the crash and later refused to give her name or confirm she was behind the wheel. She has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, three charges of causing harm by dangerous driving, leaving the scene of the accident and two counts of driving without due care. Richards was also charged with failing to answer questions about who was driving, refusing to give her name and address and hindering police. She was taken to the hospital for mandatory testing following the crash before being taken into police custody. The Advertiser reported she was taken back to the hospital a short time later. Speaking to the publication, Greg Hoy shared touching words of admiration for his late daughter Erica. \u201cShe never gave us anything to worry about,\u201d Greg Hoy said. \u201cI\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t pass away alone.\u201d Erica was traveling with her twin sister and boyfriend at the time of the crash. \u201cShe was a bright, happy, positive young girl,\u201d he continued. Erica\u2019s grieving father spoke of her passion for learning and the performing arts. \u201cShe was coming back from an acting course \u2026 when it happened,\u201d he said Erica and her identical twin Lisa, who go by the last name Kunimatsu in Japan, were born to a Japanese mother and Australian father before migrating to Australia in 2015. The pair studied arts and language courses at Flinders University and shared a roaring passion for film. Erica recently acted in a film screened at the Adelaide Film Festival and in a web series called The Reality of Humanity. \u201cShe was a really polite and positive girl,\u201d Greg Hoy said. Photographer and friend of the family Peter Hall, who had spoken to Lisa in hospital, was gutted by the tragedy. \u201cThey were soulmates, a unique artistic partnership,\u201d he told The Advertiser . \u201cI\u2019m just devastated by what has been taken away well before it was time. \u201cThere were more adventures ahead.

The study of ABC, CBS and NBC\u2019s nightly newscasts also found that President Biden is drawing far less criticism in 2022 than former President Donald Trump did during the 2018 midterm elections. Trump accounted for 48% of all midterm campaign airtime on nightly newscasts in 2018, more than all the congressional and gubernatorial candidates combined, and it was mostly negative, according to MRC. In comparison, Biden coverage during the 2022 midterms has accounted for only 16% of the networks\u2019 coverage.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Yeah. Don't stop, don't ever stop, don't ever leave me. So happy Wednesday, everyone. Do not adjust the TV. I simply got better looking since you saw me on \" The Five \" a few hours ago. If it keeps happening, I'm going to change the name of this show to \"The Ten.\" I don't need those people. WHAT'S AT STAKE AS THE SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS BANNING RACE IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS: \u2018BASIC FAIRNESS\u2019 Tonight, I want to talk about something that might not be on your radar, but will be soon, affirmative action. That's right. In college admissions, which has advanced more unqualified people than the last name Biden. On Monday, the Supreme Court heard two cases challenging the race centric policies at the University of North Carolina and Harvard, or as I call them, my safety schools. The UNC case argues that using race in admissions violates civil rights law and the Constitution, or what the Dems refer to as \"that pain in the ass scrap of paper.\" Harvard is accused of discriminating against Asian students, that's right, Harvard. You know the school that produced Joy Reid, Liz Warren, Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, all of whom love to call other people racist. They're more obsessed with color than a bomb tech cutting red and blue wires. I'm so glad you got that, I was going to cut it out. But while the left loves to defend all minorities from perceived racism, with Asians they don't give a ----. I spell it, P. H. U. K. The Asian way, thank you, thank you. I'm culturally appropriate, but that's because Asians fill spaces in great colleges in numbers that are higher than their percentage of the general population. So it's a great message for today's youth. Work hard and sacrifice, and someday you too can get moved to the back of the line. But that's how punitive ideologies work. Those who rise get pounded down in the name of equity. Video It's not about equality of opportunity anymore, but making everybody suck at the same level. But if you want that kind of mediocrity, skip college and join \"The View's\" live audience. The oral arguments between lawyers for both sides and the judges took almost 6-hours. But if anything done orally takes that long, they must be doing it wrong. What was that? What's wrong with me? Disgusting. 6-hours, we pause now to watch all of it. VIDEO Guess we loaded the wrong tape. At least they didn't load that other tape labeled oral. Anyway. I'll just fire that person later. I pay it forward by doing it in front of their children. Now experts think the court will end up banning the practice. Liberal judges, though, are against that, saying \"you can't have diversity without it.\" Now, that would make sense decades ago, when Sandra Day O'Connor once pointed out that affirmative action was a \"temporary\" remedy, something you need until you don't need it anymore. Like crutches for a sprained ankle, training wheels on a bike, or that topical cream Larry Kudlow recommended. We still have half a tube, if anyone's interested, Tyrus. A TIMELINE OF SUPREME COURT CASES ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS But the problem with leftists, they never believe anything is temporary unless it's a statue, the Bill of Rights or a fetus. But everything, therefore, that always sticks around, though they get amnesia when asked which party defended slavery and founded the KKK. Meanwhile, the court's majority questions the legal reasons for affirmative action. And when Harvard's lawyers tried to downplay using race in admissions, Chief Justice Roberts stated the obvious, \"schools who ask kids to check a box for their race, that must have some impact on admission's decisions or else it wouldn't be included.\" You know, no one adds a box if they don't want you to use that box. Take it from me, I spent four-years inside a box under Cavuto's bed. Anyway, but Roberts could have just said, \"lawyers I've got two words for you, Liz Warren, or one word Pocahontas.\" After all, she's the white lady who faked being an Indian to get into Harvard. Yeah, Liz Warren or as her tribal elders call her, \"Dances with Mayonnaise.\" People rally in support of affirmative action in college admissions as arguments start on the cases at the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill on Monday, Oct 31, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Also, if white privilege is such a huge problem, why are a third of white students pretending not to be white when applying for college? They tick the other boxes with labels like mixed, indigenous or Rachel Dolezal. So even they realize it's better to be non-white than white, and when you have that kind of institutional racism, you don't need affirmative action anymore. It's like a sprinter faking a limp so they can park in handicapped spaces. Now, the conservative justices did note they'd be willing to allow students to discuss their race in their applications, but in essay form. And that's what I did to get into Berkeley. I told them how I was raised by a black family. Which was kind of true, having watched every single episode of The Jeffersons, I love them. Of course, the left wasn't thrilled. RALLYGOERS PLEAD WITH SUPREME COURT TO END RACE-BASED ADMISSIONS: \u2018DO NOT SCAPEGOAT ASIANS\u2019 MSNBC: This Supreme Court has no problem throwing out precedent and ruling in a really partisan political way. MSNBC: If they say race can't even be considered there, next they will say it shouldn't be considered in the private sector. MSNBC: The six justices, conservative justices on the Supreme Court will let them do it because they don't actually think the diversity is important. WHOOPI GOLDBERG: The people who have benefited most from affirmative action have been women who are white... Affirmative action works for all those of us who were not allowed to go to the institutions where we thought we could do our best. Protesters called for an end to race-based discrimination at the \"Equal Education Rights for All\" rally. (Fox News Digital) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Well get used to all that, because the left is going to ram this idea home that the court getting rid of affirmative action will set the country back.

The 20-year-old from Atlanta was studying at the city\u2019s Hangyang University, as part of a US study abroad program. He had planned to meet up with several people from the course on Saturday in the Itaewon district of Seoul, to celebrate Halloween with thousands of other young revelers. But when he didn\u2019t show up, his friends and family began a frantic search to track him down, before eventually learning that he had died in the crowd crush in an overcrowded alleyway which killed 156 mostly young people. Blesi\u2019s best friend on the program was Ian Chang, 21, from Florida, who was also his neighbor in their university dorms. \u201cWe pretty much like adventures, doing spontaneous stuff,\u201d Chang told CNN in an exclusive interview this week. \u201cAnd just exploring the city.\u201d Blesi loved \u201cdancing, drinking, having fun,\u201d Chang said, and \u201cevery time he met someone new, he had a big impact on them.\u201d On Saturday night, Chang and Blesi were supposed to meet in the narrow streets of Itaewon, a popular district lined with nightclubs, bars and fast food outlets. The pair had been together earlier that day, then Chang had gone home to get changed. \u201cAt the beginning we just wanted to go to Itaewon to see how it was, see what\u2019s so special about Halloween there,\u201d Chang said. \u201cBecause we heard from people (that) Itaewon is going to be big on Halloween.\u201d But when he arrived in Itaewon around 9:40 p.m., Chang began to realize the danger that was unfolding. He sent Blesi a Snapchat message at 10:17 p.m. urging him to avoid Itaewon, and to meet up in the neighborhood of Hongdae instead. \u201cIt\u2019s too packed. And there\u2019s no place to go,\u201d Chang\u2019s message said. As news spread of the horror that unfolded in the Itaewon alleyway over the next few hours, Blesi\u2019s other friends also tried calling and messaging him. \u201cYou can come to my place \u2026 it\u2019s safe here. Where are you Steven?\u201d messaged 24-year-old Belgian exchange student, Wassim Essebane, at around 1 a.m. on Sunday via KakaoTalk, a South Korean messaging app similar to WhatsApp. Another friend, Stefanie Reuss, 22, was also trying to track Blesi down from her home more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) away in Austria. Reuss helped to raise the alarm, by posting messages on Instagram and Twitter trying to find him. One of the people Reuss contacted was 19-year-old Olivia Kim from Houston, Texas, who had been dating Blesi for a few weeks. Kim had been planning to go to Itaewon on Saturday night, but changed plans at the last minute. She was due to go on a date with Blesi on Sunday afternoon. \u201cSteven and I have been talking to each other nearly everyday for about a month after going on our first date in early October,\u201d Kim told CNN. \u201cI immediately adored his emotional generosity, wit, adventurous spirit, and optimistic personality.\u201d Kim had lost contact with Blesi on Saturday, and when he still didn\u2019t respond on Sunday morning, she began to worry that he was one of the victims. Halloween crush investigators raid police stations across Seoul Back home in Atlanta, Blesi\u2019s father, Steve, was also growing increasingly desperate. \u201cMaybe a half hour before this tragedy took place, I texted him in WhatsApp \u2026 \u2018I know you\u2019re out and about. Stay safe. I love you.\u2019 And I never got a response back,\u201d Blesi\u2019s father said. Over the next few hours, the repeated missed calls and messages went unanswered. At around 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, Chang said Blesi\u2019s mother had emailed him, looking for help in tracking down her son. Chang said they tried to call around the hospitals in Seoul, enlisting their Korean-speaking friends to help. But around midday on Sunday, they all learned the news they feared the most, after being told by Blesi\u2019s father, who had been informed by the US embassy. Another American student from the program, 20-year-old Anne Gieske from Kentucky, also died in the crowd crush on Saturday night. She had been with Blesi earlier in the evening, although it\u2019s not clear if they were together when they died. Earlier in the evening, the young partygoers had thought the overpacked streets in the Itaewon district of Seoul were part of the fun of the Halloween experience. \u201cAt the beginning we thought it was funny,\u201d said Anne-Lou Chevalier, a 22-year-old French exchange student who survived the crowd crush. \u201cWe heard Halloween in Itaewon was amazing.\u201d But when an estimated 100,000 people eventually crammed into the narrow lanes and alleyways, panic began to set in. \u201cWe (started) to be very, very stuck together and crushed, and then we heard some people screaming and crying,\u201d Chevalier said. \u201cWe were trying to help people, because there were a lot of people (who) couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d said her friend 18-year-old Alice Sannier, also from France. The friends got separated in the chaos of the crowd, and Chevalier fainted twice in the crush, adding that it felt \u201clike dying.\u201d \u201cI remember that I had no air, so I started suffocating,\u201d Chevalier said. \u201cSomehow I got evacuated with my friend, so I\u2019m very, very lucky.\u201d The two friends said their slight frames made them more vulnerable. \u201cBecause we are small in size, there (were) a lot of foreigners that were (much) taller and they were surrounding us, so at one point you cannot have some air, and then you start to freak out,\u201d Chevalier said. In total, 101 women and 55 men were killed in the disaster. Families of Halloween crush victims identify lost items as South Korean police admit mistakes Sannier and several other eyewitnesses who spoke to CNN said that they saw multiple people pushing into the crowd, which is being investigated as a possible trigger for the domino effect that took place. \u201cEveryone was pushing, that\u2019s why so many people were dying,\u201d Sannier said, adding that they didn\u2019t see any police officers when they were in the packed alleyway. Records show eleven calls had been made to police to warn about the situation in Itaewon before the crush happened on Saturday evening, and the head of South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency has said that the police response to those calls was \u201cinadequate.\u201d An investigation is underway. Friends and families of the victims are only just beginning to process what happened to their loved ones, many of whom were just starting out in life. \u201cIt is unimaginable,\u201d Reuss told CNN. Reuss had met Blesi when she spent three weeks traveling in Seoul in September. They had quickly become friends, partying together and doing karaoke and eating Korean barbecue, and they were making plans to travel together in Europe. \u201cHe was curious about the world,\u201d Reuss said. \u201cHe had so many dreams. I am very similar to him. It makes me sad.\u201d Blesi\u2019s father said his son had \u201calways been an adventurer.\u201d He was an Eagle Scout, liked basketball and wanted to learn multiple languages, he said. \u201cHe had an incredibly bright future that is now gone,\u201d he added. One of Blesi and Chang\u2019s most recent adventures was a hiking trip a few weeks ago, to the mountainous island of Jeju off the southwest coast of South Korea. \u201cWe (were) just all impressed by how far we\u2019ve been from home,\u201d Chang said. \u201cGoing on all these adventures together. And exploring something that we probably haven\u2019t thought of a year ago.\u201d As well as hiking and enjoying the food and nightlife of South Korea, Blesi also loved its cultural traditions. \u201cHe\u2019d never been to Asia so he really wanted to explore,\u201d Chang said. \u201cHe was really excited to go into, for example, temples.\u201d His friend Essebane told CNN that Blesi was \u201can absolute great guy.\u201d \u201cHe was kind, open, made you feel comfortable, had such a warm personality, and he was funny,\u201d Essebane said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget about him.\u201d In only a few months of knowing each other, Chang said he had come to think of Blesi as his \u201cbrother.\u201d \u201cSteven was the kindest person there ever was,\u201d Chang said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to have had him in my life,\u201d he added. \u201cI wish I could have made more memories with him.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "cnn", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [6.710892200469971, 5.069864749908447]}, {"title": "Yankees were just start of Cristian Javier\u2019s run of domination for Astros", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/03/yankees-were-just-start-of-cristian-javiers-run-of-domination/", "description": "Cristian Javier does not discriminate.

It wasn\u2019t just them. Cristian Javier does not discriminate. At some point in 2022, he basically stopped allowing hits. It wasn\u2019t exclusive to Aaron Judge and Co. Javier has a fastball that hardly awes in velocity. But it is illustrious because it is an illusion. He slings it from a low three-quarters arm slot with lots of backspin, giving the optical perception that it is rising simply because it is not descending by following basic laws of gravity. The Phillies actually had been strong against fastballs up in the zone this season. Not this version. You can\u2019t hit what you can\u2019t see. His catcher, Christian Vazquez, called Javier\u2019s fastball, \u201cThe best pitch in baseball.\u201d What would the argument against that be after World Series Game 4? After the Phillies of Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber were as helpless as the Yankees of Judge and Anthony Rizzo. The Phillies, in fact, went from in control of this World Series and supported by a joyous home crowd to being on the wrong end of history and being booed. The mood at Citizens Bank Ballpark morphed from sea of red to see us dread in 24 hours. Like he did on June 25 against the Yankees , Javier did the heavy lifting in a tag-team no-hitter. This, of course, however, is not June 25 and the 71st game of the regular season. This was just the second time a team was held without a hit in a World Series contest. The other was Don Larsen\u2019s perfecto in Game 5 in 1956 for the Yankees against the Dodgers. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a [bleep],\u201d Schwarber said of being part of history. He sounded the Phillies theme \u2014 of one game, one loss, the 118th World Series is now a best-of-three with the teams tied two games apiece after the Astros\u2019 5-0 victory . Nick Castellanos mentioned being combined no-hit by the Mets in late April and recovering to get all the way to this moment. But, of course, this was not just another day at the yard. It was so much \u2014 and so much less. Larsen threw a perfect game by himself. Roy Halladay threw the only other no-hitter in postseason history \u2014 for the Phillies in a 2010 Division Series against Dusty Baker\u2019s Reds. Now, Baker, the Astros manager, saw Javier at 97 pitches after six innings. His career-high was 115 against the Yankees in the June no-hitter. Baker said he thought about Javier\u2019s \u201chealth and career\u201d over history. It wasn\u2019t 1956, not even 2010. Baker summed it all up this way: \u201cIt\u2019s baseball in 2022.\u201d Indeed. That this was in Philly rather than Houston and that this was not a solo achievement robbed something in ambience and meaning. But did not lower Javier\u2019s brilliance. He walked Harper in the second and No. 9 hitter Brandon Marsh on four pitches in the third. That seemed to lock him in. He retired 11 in a row from there \u2014 five straight on strikeouts at one juncture. The closest the Phillies came to a hit was a Schwarber grounder just foul in the third inning. He struck out instead. The Phillies managed just one ball to the outfield against Javier. Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly finished and the question immediately became how much could Javier give on short rest in Game 7, if that were necessary. Baker sheepishly admitted his mind already had navigated there and thought two or three frames. How could you not use the hardest-to-hit pitcher going if everything is at stake, potentially completing an underdog rise. After all, Javier signed later than most Dominican youths with baseball promise, just after going from an outfielder to a pitcher and just before his 18th birthday and only for $10,000. He has graduated from afterthought to ace. The 25-year-old righty threw 148 \u00b2/\u2083 innings this year and his .170 batting average against was the best for anyone who threw at least 125 innings. The Yankees faced him three times in 2022, including the ALCS, and managed three hits and one run in 17 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. Since Sept. 14, he has started six times and pitched at least five shutout innings with two or fewer hits in each \u2014 opposing hitters in 38 innings are 8-for-117 against him (.068). Javier was given the assignment to pitch the Astros back into this series and counter a wave elevated by a crowd of 45,693 Wednesday that included Bruce Springsteen. Javier was clearly The Boss. He did this throwing his four-seam fastball on 70 of 97 pitches. He averaged 93.8 mph. The average of a postseason fastball to begin Game 4 was 95.3. But Schwarber mentioned \u201chis extension and ride.\u201d Harper his \u201cspin rate.\u201d With Javier, it is not speed as much as deception. Now you see it, now you don\u2019t.

The Houston Astros evened up the World Series in memorable fashion on Wednesday as the team's pitchers combined for a no-hitter in a 5-0 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. It was only the second no-hitter in World Series history, and the first combined no-hitter in Major League Baseball postseason history. Pitcher Cristian Javier started the game for Houston, which tied the series 2-2 with the win. Javier pitched the first six innings, joining the New York Yankees' Don Larsen as the only pitchers in World Series history to finish a game with no hits allowed in six or more innings pitched. Larsen pitched the only perfect game in the World Series in 1956. A trio of relievers finished the game for Javier and Houston. In total, Javier recorded 18 outs from 97 pitches on Wednesday. Houston came into Game Four of the Series needing to slow down a scorching Philadelphia offense that smacked five home runs in a 7-0 thumping in Game Three. On Wednesday night, Houston's pitchers brought that offense to a screeching halt. For Javier, 70 of his 97 pitches were fastballs that blew past Phillies batters. Houston catcher Christian Vasquez told Fox Sports that Javier's pitches were the best fastballs he had seen. Javier, 25 and a native of the Dominican Republic, becomes the first pitcher ever to start multiple combined no-hitters within a career. On June 25 in Yankee Stadium, Javier threw 115 pitches and recorded 21 outs. Game Five of the Series is Thursday night in Philadelphia.

Verlander is set to hit the open market, since he has a $25 million player option and figures to be able to get at least a one-year deal worth somewhere around $40 million \u2014 or even a longer deal \u2014 now that he\u2019s come back successfully from Tommy John surgery. He pitched just one game in 2020 and missed all of last season, but returned this year in top form, finishing with a league-leading 1.75 ERA and 0.829 WHIP in 175 innings over 28 starts with Houston. He should now be in line for a deal worth an annual salary in the neighborhood of the $43.3 million per year Max Scherzer is making with the Mets. The one red flag has been a pair of shaky outings in the postseason, including in Game 1 of the World Series against Philadelphia, when Verlander allowed five runs in five innings, blowing a five-run lead in the process. But he also held the Yankees to one run over six innings in Game 1 of the ALCS, striking out 11. The Yankees were interested in Verlander last year and offered him a one-year deal for $25 million, but Houston topped it with the second-year player option. Verlander acknowledged the possible finality of Thursday\u2019s outing in Philadelphia. \u201cReally and truly, it\u2019s been a hell of a ride no matter what happens,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cWhether I stay or don\u2019t, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time with this group of guys and the city and getting to know the city.

The Giants are another possible landing spot, especially with Carlos Rodon likely leaving as a free agent. The Yankees have a solid rotation set for next season already, with Gerrit Cole at the top, Nestor Cortes and Frankie Montas back and likely Luis Severino, who has a $15 million team option, with Domingo German and Clarke Schmidt possible fifth starters or depth, with Jameson Taillon a free agent. If the Yankees are looking to make a splash, they could look to Verlander. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about it,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said of free agency. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be present.

There was Tom Thibodeau, who spent most of the night looking like someone who\u2019d eaten a bad batch of chicken wings for dinner. There was Leon Rose, who had to have noticed that for the second straight game a player the Knicks were linked to this summer lit his team aflame. Sunday night in Cleveland it was Donovan Mitchell and his 38 points and 12 assists. Wednesday it was Dejounte Murray and his 36 points and nine assists and six steals. And, of course, there were the 19,812 people inside the Garden, who spent the game\u2019s first 15 or so minutes making the old gym sound like a bachelor party at McSorley\u2019s, then spent the final 33 minutes wondering if the Knicks would have been able to give an NAIA team a solid run. It was that bad. It was that brutal. It was a 112-99 loss to the Hawks , which has become one of the more galling parts of this Knicks era, Trae Young and friends walking into the Garden and ransacking the place the way Led Zeppelin used to wreck hotels, doing whatever they want, scoring at will, blowing the doors off the home team. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do better,\u201d Thibodeau groused. Seven games into the season, the Knicks are already a team in crisis. This looked, in so many troubling ways, like so many games out of last year. They seized a 23-point lead in the second quarter, and then were outscored by 42 \u2014 by 42! \u2014 across the next 25 minutes. The crowd implored them for a while but even the faithful lost faith after seeing so much carnage. \u201cIt was compounded,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cIf you\u2019re missing shots, they\u2019re pushing the ball up the floor, giving them easy buckets the other way. They\u2019re going to make up ground quickly. And they did.\u201d The Knicks were porous on defense, ponderous on offense, poor in transition, patsies off the glass (17 offensive rebounds for Atlanta) and none of those things was the worst part of the night.

That\u2019s how a nine-point fourth-quarter lead became a 13-point loss Sunday night in Cleveland. That\u2019s how 23-up became 19-down, settling on another 13-point loss Wednesday at MSG. That won\u2019t do. That won\u2019t do it all. And none of the players the Knicks are going to lean heavily on \u2014 Julius Randle, Jalen Brunson, RJ Barrett \u2014 were able to do anything about it, even though Young missed a large portion of the second half after getting poked in the eye and started the game missing 10 of his first 12 shots. Murray was more than enough, helping to erase much of the 23-point spread by himself on both ends of the floor. (If you happen to be a fan of the movie \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d maybe you could at least enjoy the fact that the Knicks\u2019 two failed offseason pursuits were Mitch and Murray. And maybe you smiled and yelled at your TV screen as a surrogate for Rose: \u201cPut that coffee down. Coffee is for closers only.\u201d) But that was the only smile available. This was no laughing matter. This is no laughing matter. As feel-good as the Knicks 3-1 start was, there was a genuine understanding that those wins had come against some seriously undermanned opponents. The varsity arrived with a sobering loss in Milwaukee, backed up by the Cleveland flop. Now it\u2019s three in a row, and the schedule doesn\u2019t ease up for another week, and there needs to be a profound change in how they\u2019re doing things because we have seen before how 3-4 can become 3-8 in the blink of an eye. And don\u2019t think the rest of the league didn\u2019t notice how the Knicks evaporated once the Hawks threw a zone at them. \u201cAll we can do is learn from it,\u201d Obi Toppin said, \u201cand get better.\u201d The games come at you fast: Philly, Boston, Minnesota, Brooklyn. The Knicks are in crisis but not yet calamity \u2014 basketball calamity in New York, for now anyway, is strictly the purview of Brooklyn.

Professional cornhole has been rocked by controversy after the top-ranked team was accused of using illegal bean bags at the 2022 American Cornhole League World Championships in August. Dubbed \u201cBagGate,\u201d the now-infamous incident began when player Devon Harbaugh complained that rival opponents Mark Richards and Philip Lopez were using bags that were smaller than regulation during the finals, which were broadcasted live on ESPN from Rock Hill, South Carolina. \u201cI thought the bags were too thin,\u201d Harbaugh told The Wall Street Journal \u2014 and he was right. Officials gathered to inspect Richards and Lopez\u2019s bean bags and confirmed that they were, in fact, not regulation size. \u201cThey\u2019re too small,\u201d ESPN\u2019s cornhole color commentator Mark Pryor remarked. \u201cThat\u2019s going to create some drama.\u201d In response, Lopez and Richards requested that their opponents bags also be inspected. Their bags were also found to be not compliant. According to ACL regulations, cornhole bags must be 6 by 6 inches when laid flat and weigh 16 ounces, with minor variations tolerated. A one hour delay ensued before officials determined that the violations were not intentional and decided to continue the competition with a $15,000 cash prize at stake. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m pretty confident that it wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d ACL spokesman Trey Ryder told WSJ regarding cheating allegations. Cornhole, a staple at tailgates and barbecues, has rapidly evolved from the simple yard game that can be played while drinking a beer to serious competition with professional athletes and sponsors. And it\u2019s just getting bigger. There are currently 155,000 members of the ACL, up 30,000 members from 2021. The league hosted 22,000 events in 2022, up from 14,000 in 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported. ACL\u2019s top players earn as much as $250,000 a year from winnings, sponsorship deals and endorsements. With such a major expansion and influx of money, players have been doing whatever they can to get a leg up on the competition, including doctoring their bags. Lighter and thinner bags can be advantageous and players have been boiling their bags or washing them with vinegar to make them more pliable. \u201cYou have the average players that try everything to make the bag do different things,\u201d Nate Voyer, a cornhole professional, told the Journal. Voyer chooses to wash his bag with a little fabric softener and let it air dry. Harbaugh denied manipulating his bags for the ACL World Championship. \u201cHonestly it could be anything,\u201d he says. \u201cDefinitely unintentional.\u201d His opponent, Lopez, also said he doesn\u2019t know how his bags shrunk, denying that he boiled them. In response to \u201cBagGate,\u201d ACL has had to step up its policing. \u201cWe\u2019ve really had to crack down to make sure that all these bags are to spec,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cInternally we\u2019ve had to invest more into our compliance.\u201d More bags than ever have been rejected for the upcoming season, when random bag checks will be in place, he said. The league is also exploring \u201cautomated bag testing.\u201d \u201cWe believe we are taking a major step,\u201dRyder added. Eric Marvin, president of the American Cornhole Association \u2014 which calls itself the Original and Official Governing Body of Cornhole \u2014 said new team rules and regulations will be announced by the end of the year. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see some big shifts and movements in the infrastructure of the sport,\u201d Marvin said. \u201cThis is when sports evolve.\u201d Professional cornholer Jay Corley told the Journal that he sees only one solution for the rapidly-growing game. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to go to having a referee just like any other sport.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-19.260465621948242, -9.52194595336914]}, {"title": "World Series 2022: Astros throw first combined no-hitter in MLB postseason history, tie series at 2", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/world-series-2022-astros-throw-first-combined-no-hitter-mlb-postseason-history-tie-series-2", "description": "Four Houston Astros pitchers combined to no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the World Series on Wednesday night for the third no-hitter in postseason history.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for November 2 Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

Houston Astros ' Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly combined to no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies in their 5-0 win in Game 4 of the World Series, tying the series at two. It was the third no-hitter in postseason history - two of which have been thrown at Citizens Bank Park - and the second thrown in the Fall Classic.

(Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) Don Larsen threw the first postseason no-hitter in on Oct. 8, 1956 in Game 5 of the World Series as a New York Yankee against the Brooklyn Dodgers. In Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series on Oct. 6, Roy Halladay , then a member of the Phillies, no-hit the Cincinnati Reds. Funny enough, Dusty Baker, the current manager of the Astros, was the manager of that Reds team. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Javier got the start for the Astros, and in his 97 pitches, he tossed six no-hit innings while striking out nine and walking two. In his last eight appearances (spanning 41.0 innings), he has allowed just two earned runs (0.44 ERA). Javier also started the Astros' combined no-hitter from June 25 against the Yankees in the Bronx. That afternoon, Javier threw seven no-hit innings against the Bombers, while Hector Neris and Pressly got the final six outs. Abreu was the next man out of the pen, and he struck out all three batters he faced in the seventh. Dusty Baker then brought in Montero, and he retired the side in the eighth.

(Sarah Stier/Getty Images) ASTROS' LANCE MCCULLERS JR. ACCUSED OF TIPPING PITCHES DURING WORLD SERIES BEATDOWN Then it was an easy choice for Baker, as he brought in the closer Pressly. He struck out Brandon Marsh to start the bottom of the ninth, but walked Kyle Schwarber (which was the Phillies' first baserunner since the third inning). But Rhys Hoskins flied out, and J.T. Realmuto grounded out to third to end it. It's quite ironic that the no-hitter comes just 24 hours after Game 3 starter Lance McCullers was thought to be tipping pitches - he allowed five home runs in the Astros' 7-0 loss on Tuesday, and videos circulated of what may have been a tell with his legs. But on Wednesday, the Phillies looked clueless all night. The Astros had some early rallies, but ultimately couldn\u2019t cash in as their scoreless streak reached 16 innings. But in the fifth inning, they had had enough. The Astros loaded the bases with no outs and Yordan Alvarez at the plate. That ended Aaron Nola\u2019s night, but Jose Alvarado\u2019s first pitch hit Alvarez, bringing in the first run of the game. The next batter, Alex Bregman, drove in two runs with a double. Kyle Tucker\u2019s sac fly made it a 4-0 game, and Yuli Gurriel drove in another run with a single. The win forces a Game 6, which will be played on Saturday night in Houston. Game 7, if necessary, would be played Sunday night. It also gets Houston to avoid what would have been a devastating 3-1 hole.

From five home runs to no hits for the Phillies.", "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 No, no, you have got to be kidding. One night after they were manhandled by a lineup that resembled a Murderers\u2019 Row, the Astros got even Wednesday in maybe the sweetest possible manner. They no-hit the Phillies. Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero and Ryan Pressly handled the heavy lifting in a 5-0 victory over the Phillies in Game 4 of the World Series at Citizens Bank Park. The series, tied 2-2, is now ensured of returning to Houston this weekend. The teams will play Game 5 on Thursday, when Justin Verlander is scheduled to face Noah Syndergaard. Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game against the Dodgers in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series remains the fall standard for a pitching performance. But Wednesday marked only the second time (and first since Larsen\u2019s gem for the Yankees) that a team got no-hit in the World Series. The only other no-hitter in postseason history was thrown by the Phillies\u2019 Roy Halladay in Game 1 of the 2010 NLDS against the Reds in this ballpark. On Tuesday, the Phillies blasted five home runs in destroying the Astros to take the series lead, but Javier set an early tone Wednesday before Abreu, Montero and Pressly handled the rest. A moment of pause came in the eighth when Jean Segura hit a screaming line drive to right field. But Kyle Tucker was positioned perfectly and caught it for the inning\u2019s final out. In the ninth, Pressly struck out Brandon Marsh and walked Kyle Schwarber \u2014 the third Phillies batter to reach base on a walk \u2014 before Rhys Hoskins flied to right and J.T. Realmuto grounded out to third base, beginning the celebration. Javier continued the brilliance he displayed in his previous five starts \u2014 all games in which he allowed two hits or fewer over five innings. Included was a dismantling of the Yankees in Game 4 of the ALCS, when he allowed one hit over 5 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. Overall, he has surrendered only seven hits over his last 34 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. Departing a game with no hits allowed is old hat for Javier, who combined with Hector Neris and Pressly to no-hit the Yankees on June 25 in The Bronx. It marked the first time the Yankees had been no-hit since 2003 (also by the Astros). Abreu entered for the seventh inning on this night and struck out the side \u2014 Realmuto, Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos \u2014 to keep the no-hitter going. In a third straight underwhelming start, Aaron Nola was removed after 67 pitches with the bases loaded and nobody out in the fifth. The right-hander allowed three earned runs on seven hits and a hit batsman. It followed a Game 1 clunker that saw Nola allowed five earned runs over 4 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. That followed a performance against the Padres in the NLCS in which he allowed six earned runs over 4 \u00b2/\u2083 innings. The Astros loaded the bases on consecutive singles by Chas McCormick, Jose Altuve and Jeremy Pena to begin the fifth, ending Nola\u2019s night. Jose Alvarado drilled Yordan Alvarez with his first pitch, bringing in the game\u2019s first run. Alex Bregman\u2019s ensuing double extended the Astros\u2019 lead to 3-0. Alvarado retired Tucker on a fly to center that brought in the inning\u2019s fourth run before Yuli Gurriel delivered an RBI single that buried the Phillies in a 5-0 hole. The Astros had early opportunities that went unfulfilled. In the second inning, Christian Vazquez was plunked by a pitch to give the Astros runners on the corners with one out, but Nola responded by striking out Aledmys Diaz and McCormick in succession. In the fourth, Gurriel and Vazquez delivered consecutive two-out singles before Diaz was retired. Bryce Harper walked leading off the second for the Phillies and stole second, but advanced no further.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! First, the good news. The conventional view among people who follow politics is that the Democratic Party is about to suffer a humiliating repudiation in next week's midterm elections. It seems very likely as of now, that Democrats will lose both houses of Congress, and that's just the beginning of their pain. Polls suggest that even places that supported Joe Biden by a wide margin in 2020 are about to swing dramatically against him and his party. A week from today, New York, of all places, could have a Republican governor. The last time there was an election in New York, Biden won the state by 23 points. What we're seeing is what political scientists refer to as a realignment, and there's no mystery as to why it's happening. Democrats failed conclusively. No group in American history has done a worse job running this country than the neoliberals currently in charge. They're vicious, they're intolerant and they are utterly corrupt, but above all, they are incompetent. In less than two years, it is not an overstatement to say, they have run this country into the ground, wrecking our economy, desecrating our military and opening the borders of the United States to more than 5 million lawbreakers. The destruction they have wrought is so profound it's hard to describe. So of course, there will be consequences for that. In a country with democratic elections , how could this party stay in power? Honestly, we don't know, but maybe Joe Biden does. Tonight, Biden traveled across the city of Washington to Union Station. Built by Teddy Roosevelt more than 100 years ago, Union Station was for generations one of the most beautiful public buildings in this country. Under Joe Biden, it has become a homeless encampment, a place that is too filthy and too dangerous for Starbucks. Standing at this monument to his own failures, Biden proceeded to do what he now so commonly does: Bark at the rest of us for our moral failures. The guy who showered with his daughter is telling you you're a bad person. Tonight's topic: Democracy. Here's a taste of it. WHITE HOUSE WON'T SAY IF IT PLANS TO PAY FOR TWITTER OR IF REPUBLIC WILL SURVIVE GOP TAKEOVER OF CONGRESS U.S. President Joe Biden speaks before signing the agreement for Finland and Sweden to be included in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the East Room of the White House on August 9, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yet now, extreme MAGA Republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections, but elections being held now and into the future. The extreme MAGA element of the Republican Party, which is a minority of that party, as I said earlier, but it's the driving force is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. Well, that's very weird if you think about it. Here we are less than a week before the Democratic Party is expected to suffer overwhelming losses in the midterm elections and here you have the leader of that party, Joe Biden, commanding you not to complain about the election results. Why is that? Well, let's see. Here's Joe Biden telling you that thanks to the changes, the many changes, Democrats have made to our system of voting, all of which make voter fraud easier to commit, we may not know the results of the elections for a few days, but don't be alarmed. Everything is completely on the level and whatever you do, do not ask questions or else you're a criminal. BIDEN: We want Americans to vote. We want every American's voice to be heard. Now we have to move the process forward. We know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting or by mail in America. We know that many states don't start counting those ballots until after the polls close on Nov. 8. That means in some cases we won't know the winner of the election \u2014 for a few days, until a few days after the election. It takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner. It's always been important for citizens in a democracy to be informed and engaged. Now it's important for citizens to be patient as well. That's how it's supposed to work. HILLARY CLINTON QUESTIONS WHETHER VOTERS 'REALLY UNDERSTAND' WHAT\u2019S AT STAKE IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS What is this? What is going on here? We're a week from the election, six days. Biden could have given, would under normal circumstances have given, a speech about his policies and how they've made your life better. He tried to convince you this country is actually in better shape than it looks and he did that. He could, in other words, have made a pitch for your vote based on what he has done. That's what politicians do in functioning democracies. They try to convince you to support them on the basis of what they have done for you. That is democracy. That's not at all what Joe Biden just did. Instead, Biden commanded you to accept the election results whenever they arrive, no matter what they may be. It was bizarre and it did not inspire confidence. You would hate to think that what's happening here is a version of what is happening tonight in Brazil. According to official tallies, a convicted criminal, an avowed socialist, called Lula da Silva, beat the incumbent president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro , by a narrow margin this weekend and yet millions of Brazilians, millions, don't believe that's what actually happened. Bolsonaro himself has not conceded. There are protests all over Brazil right now. You're seeing some of them on your screen right now. There are questions about whether all the ballots had been counted, why so many were thrown out \u2014 millions \u2014 and whether election laws were violated in the process. We can't render judgment on those questions, but if you care about democracy, if you think the process is essential, then you would look into those allegations. Anything less is not democracy, and yet what's interesting and maybe a point of concern for the rest of us here in the U.S., is that you are no longer allowed to ask questions about this election in Brazil and you're not allowed because the Biden administration doesn't want you to. That's true. YouTube, which has functioned for the last two years as an arm of the Biden administration, has announced it is censoring any posts in Brazil that question the election results. Brazil's courts have also rejected any inquiry into the election. BRAZIL ELECTION: LULA DA SILVA WINS PRESIDENCY AS NATION SWINGS LEFT \u2014 WILL BOLSONARO ACCEPT THE RESULTS? Video In fact, a Supreme Court judge in Brazil has also ordered social media companies to remove any social media post that questions the outcome. Overwhelming censorship in a \"democracy,\" preventing people from asking questions about how the \"democracy functions.\" So, why should you care about this? Brazil, it's a long way away. Well, two reasons. The first is that the result of this election will determine the extent of China's influence in the Western Hemisphere. If Bolsonaro is determined the loser and da Silva does become the president of Brazil, that means that left-wing governments loyal to China outside of our sphere of influence will control all of South America. Brazil was the last holdout, also the biggest and most significant country in South America. Bolsonaro, alone in South America, stood in the way of total Chinese hegemony there. It's our hemisphere. It matters, but the second reason you should be paying attention to this is that the crackdown on free speech in the wake of Brazil's contested election is a result of policies from our country. The Biden administration has been interfering in the elections in Brazil, period. The Biden administration has already announced that Bolsonaro lost and then threatened Bolsonaro with consequences if he tries to contest the result of the election in his country. The State Department, the Biden State Department, put out a statement saying that Bolsonaro's defeat \"reinforces\" trust in democratic institutions. Really? This is an election that is contested. The demonstrations in the streets prove that. That has not been audited. That apparently cannot be audited by fiat and that you\u2019re not allowed to talk about. How does that restore your faith in institutions? No. Only one thing restores your faith in institutions and that's transparency. When people are hiding things, it makes you think maybe they have reason to, of course, and when governments hide things, you can be dead certain they're lying, period, but from an American perspective, the question is why was the Biden administration interfering in a foreign election? These are defenders of democracy who believe in free and fair elections. They shouldn't be meddling in other people's elections, but they are a lot. LIZ CHENEY CAMPAIGNS FOR DEMOCRATS IN AN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK TRUMP'S ALLIES FROM WINNING IN MIDTERMS Several years ago, Toria Nuland at the State Department, the woman who is driving our war against Russia, was caught on tape admitting that she had engineered a coup in Ukraine. Was she punished for that? No, she was promoted. Again, she's still at the State Department. It does make you wonder what we've been doing in Brazil. The Biden administration hated the last president in Brazil for political reasons, ideological reasons, reasons that had nothing to do with what was in America's best interest, but had everything to do with the silly lifestyle liberalism that determines that worldview. Last year, our CIA director, William Burns, traveled to Brazil, and while there warned top officials that Bolsonaro could not contest the election results no matter what. Wait a second. Why would the CIA chief be in Brazil lecturing them about their elections? Isn't that interfering in an election? Oh, yes, it is. Then, months after that visit from the head of our CIA, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the indefinite detention of several Bolsonaro supporters without a trial. What did they do wrong? What was their crime? They \"attacked Brazil's institutions\" in their private communications. They undermined confidence in election integrity, so they had to go to prison. It's shocking and the most shocking part is not simply that there's corruption in a Latin American country. That's part. The shocking part is that the Biden administration is abetting it and reinforcing it and trying to do the same thing here. BIDEN EXPECTED TO RALLY DEMS WITH BLISTERING REMARKS ABOUT DEMOCRACY BEING ON THE BALLOT, MAGA REPUBLICANS Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro arrives to speak from his official residence of Alvorada Palace in Brasilia, Brazil, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022, the leader's first public comments since losing the Oct. 30 presidential runoff. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) We saw a preview of this in the United States after January 6. What's happening in Brazil now is an escalation and once again, the Biden administration endorses it, has a hand in it. Within hours of the contested election, people have been banned from talking about it. Street violence is breaking out naturally. So-called election-deniers are being killed. Why would you imagine any other outcome? In the absence of transparency, what fills the void? Conspiracy theories. If you want people to believe the truth, tell them the truth. Stop hiding things. That's not a functioning democracy. In a functioning democracy, you're not simply allowed to raise questions about elections, you're encouraged to. You're encouraged to because it's your government. There's no such thing as election-denying in a free society. It's called free speech. You're allowed to say it if you think it, period, and yet our media, which exists to defend free speech, is doing its best, day after day, to shut it down. \"How dare you raise any questions about next week's midterms! Why are they telling you that? It's ominous.\" Here's MSNBC's Ali Velshi making an explicit. Watch as he explains that if you vote for a Republican in Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano, you're destroying democracy through voting. ALI VELSHI: Of those 299 election-denying candidates, that's them on the screen, 173 of them are favored to win their race this year, while 52 others are in competitive races where they still have a chance of winning. Their collective victory could have catastrophic consequences for American democracy... It's possible that in a couple of years, as the results of the 2024 presidential elections are being certified, people like Lake and Finchem in Arizona, Mastriano in Pennsylvania, and over 150 members of Congress who have spent these last two years sowing seeds of doubt about the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory. It's likely they'll be in positions of power that have an outsized influence on the outcome of future elections and what they might do with that power is what voters need to be thinking about today.

Show us the facts. If people are worried about vote totals in a specific state from 2020, first of all, they have a right to have the party in charge prove that that election was fair, but moreover, they have a duty to ask because the only way you have a free and fair system is if everybody is free to ask questions about it and demand real answers. If you're coming up with some sort of crazy theory about what happened in Nancy Pelosi's house last Friday, instead of yelling at you or calling you names or telling you you're a conspiracy nut, you're Alex Jones, just produce the police body cam. Why is that so hard? If you think something weird was going on January 6, OK, it's not your fault. Maybe it's the fault of the people who are hiding thousands of hours of video evidence from January 6. Why haven't they released that? The onus is on them, not the rest of us. We're not the crazy people. You're the liars. There's nothing wrong with asking questions \u2014 period \u2014 and if that's banned, this is a totalitarian country.

The school already had barred the two coaches from off-campus recruiting this past summer. It will also reduce the number of official visits during the 2023-24 academic year, reduce the total number of scholarships by three over a three-year span and reduce the number of permissible recruiting days during the upcoming year by 13 days. There were no official visitors this year for Late Night at the Phog, the annual celebration to kick off the season. \u201cCoach Townsend and I accept and support KU\u2019s decision,\u201d Self said in a statement. \u201cWe are in good hands with Coach Roberts, and I am confident that he will do a great job on the bench leading our team. I am proud of the way our guys have handled this situation and I look forward to returning to the bench for our game against N.C. State.\u201d The infractions case against Kansas stems from a federal investigation in 2017 that led to the conviction of shoe company executives, a middleman who worked with them and several assistant coaches. Kansas was among the schools named in the case, along with Arizona, LSU, Louisville and N.C. State. The Kansas case hinged on whether representatives of apparel company Adidas were considered boosters \u2014 the school contends they were not \u2014 when two of them arranged payments to prospective recruits. The school never disputed that the payments were made, only that it had any knowledge that the inducements were happening. Auburn received four years of probation through a traditional NCAA infractions process for a similar case, but Kansas joined other schools in appealing its case to an Independent Accountability Review Panel, which was among the proposals made by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2018 to reform the sport. The panel works outside the purview of the NCAA and was designed to handle particularly complex cases. But its work has been painfully slow \u2014 NCAA president Mark Emmert acknowledged the process takes \u201cway too long\u201d \u2014 and Kansas decided to self-impose restrictions while continuing to wait for the IARP to announce its decision. \u201cWe are hopeful these difficult self-imposed sanctions will assist in bringing the case to a conclusion,\u201d Kansas athletic director Travis Goff said in a statement, and declining any additional comment. \u201cUntil then, we will continue to focus on supporting our outstanding men\u2019s basketball student-athletes and coaches.\u201d Kansas had already doubled down on Self by signing him to a new contract in April 2021. Under the terms of the five-year deal, Self gets one additional year after the conclusion of each season \u2014 in effect, making it a lifetime contract. It guaranteed him $5.41 million per year with a base salary of $225,000, a professional services contract of $2.75 million and an annual $2.435 million retention bonus. The contract includes a clause that states the school cannot fire Self for cause \u201cdue to any current infractions matter that involves conduct that occurred on or prior to\u201d the signing of the deal. And while he would have to forfeit half of his base salary and professional services pay while serving any Big 12 or NCAA suspension, it\u2019s unclear whether that includes any self-imposed suspensions such as the one handed down Wednesday. \u201cThroughout this process, we have had ongoing conversations with all the involved parties,\u201d Kansas chancellor Douglas A. Girod said in a statement. \u201cWe believe the actions we are announcing today move us closer to resolving this matter.\u201d Making the Kansas case more complex, though, is the rapidly shifting landscape of college sports. Some of the alleged infractions from the 2017 investigation would no longer be against the rules following name, image and likeness legislation, which has allowed athletes in all sports to begin making money from endorsements and other off-the-field business arrangements. Meanwhile, the days of postseason bans and crippling scholarship reductions as punishments appear to be ending. Memphis was placed on three years of probation in August and slapped with a public reprimand and fine for violations in the recruitment of James Wiseman, now with the Golden State Warriors. But the Tigers escaped any scholarship penalties or postseason bans because the IARP said it did not want to punish current athletes. Even as the IARP continues to work on several cases, the NCAA\u2019s Division I Transformation Committee earlier this year put forth a recommendation to end the process. The proposal was swiftly adopted by the Division I Board of Directors. \u201cWe look forward to commenting further when this process is fully resolved,\u201d Girod said of the IARP process. \u201cUntil then, I want to reiterate our unwavering support of Coach Self and our men\u2019s basketball program.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-17.536243438720703, -6.416754245758057]}, {"title": "Knicks have no answers for Dejounte Murray, Hawks in ugly loss", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/02/knicks-have-no-answers-for-dejounte-murray-hawks-after-blowing-early-lead/", "description": "The Garden rivalry with the Hawks in recent seasons mainly has been about one opposing player, with Trae Young forever cementing himself as a New York villain in a first-round elimination of the Knicks in 2021.

But it was Young\u2019s dynamic new backcourt mate Dejounte Murray who destroyed the Knicks on Wednesday night, as the Hawks stormed back from a 23-point first-half deficit and sent Tom Thibodeau\u2019s team to its third straight defeat with a 112-99 dismantling at the Garden. The oft-booed Young was held to 17 points on 7-for-22 shooting, but Murray \u2014 a 2021 All-Star obtained from the Spurs in the offseason \u2014 netted 23 of his game-high 36 in the first half as the Hawks improved to 5-3. One game after offseason target Donovon Mitchell torched the Knicks for 38 in Cleveland, Murray \u2014 another player they failed to obtain in the offseason \u2014 also posted nine assists and six steals over an electrifying 38 minutes. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks (3-4) with 20 points, with RJ Barrett scoring 19 and Julius Randle finishing with 14. Second-year guard Quentin Grimes (foot soreness) was cleared to play for the first time this season, but he didn\u2019t get off the bench until 4:48 remained in the fourth quarter, with Cam Reddish maintaining his spot for at least one more game on the second unit. The Knicks led by as many as 13 during the first quarter, despite Brunson sitting down after picking up his second foul 4:43 into the game. Derrick Rose replaced him and drilled a 3-pointer from the right side to cap a 13-0 run with under a minute left in the session. Young missed 10 of 12 early attempts from the floor and finished the quarter with five points and a minus-11 rating over the first 12 minutes. Of course, the Garden fans began chanting \u201cF\u2013k Trae Young\u201d during the Hawks\u2019 five-game playoff elimination of the Knicks in 2021, and Young responded to the continued taunts by dropping 45 points in an Atlanta victory in his lone Manhattan appearance last season on March 22. \u201cYou guys still talking about that? Of course he gets excited,\u201d Atlanta coach Nate McMillan said before the game. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him about this but Trae feeds off of that. He\u2019s a big moment player. \u201cYou come to the Garden it\u2019s a big moment, it\u2019s a big place to play. All the good players I think in the league look forward to coming here and playing and playing well.\u201d Reddish, and not Grimes, replaced Barrett to open the second quarter as the second unit extended the Knicks\u2019 lead to 15 on Obi Toppin\u2019s reverse layup off a football pass from Isaiah Hartenstein two minutes into the period and to 18 on Toppin\u2019s 3-pointer 23 seconds later. Toppin also dropped in another bucket from downtown for 10 points in the quarter, as the Knicks extended their led to 23 with seven minutes to go before halftime. But Young netted 10 in a 29-14 closeout run by the Hawks \u2014 with Murray pouring in 18 in the quarter \u2014 to shave the Knicks\u2019 lead to 65-57 heading into intermission. The Hawks then registered the first 10 points of the second half, taking the lead on Young\u2019s transition layup three minutes into the third. On the Knicks\u2019 next offensive possession, Young appeared to take a shot in the face in a collision with Randle and temporarily came out of the game. His replacement, Aaron Holiday, buried another 3 to extend the Atlanta run to open the third to 10-0. The Knicks shot 5-for-19 overall in the third and clanked all nine of their 3-point attempts, while committing nine of their 16 turnovers, to trail 89-75 entering the final quarter. Immanuel Quickley\u2019s left-side 3-pointer drew the Knicks back within 10 with barely seven minutes to go in the fourth, but consecutive treys by De\u2019Andre Hunter (21 points) and Murray pushed the Atlanta advantage back to 18 with 5:18 remaining.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-18.809499740600586, -3.411823034286499]}, {"title": "Ex-Mets catcher Ed Hearn needs kidney transplant", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/02/ex-mets-catcher-ed-hearn-needs-kidney-transplant/", "description": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Ed Hearn\u2019s tenure with the Mets was brief, but he left a lasting impression on teammates.

The latest bombshell from The Intercept, based on communications unveiled in the federal lawsuit Missouri v. Biden, shows that the Department of Homeland Security has been having monthly meetings with Facebook and Twitter to pressure them to censor social-media posts about topics such as the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the origins of COVID-19, the efficacy of COVID vaccines, racial justice and US support for the war in Ukraine \u2014 In other words, anything that could be detrimental to public support for the Biden administration. We already know that the FBI was involved in efforts to censor and bury information that might have harmed Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy back in 2020, including The Post\u2019s exclusive about Hunter Biden \u2019s laptop in October 2020. That amounted to election interference, which successfully prevented the American people from doing the necessary due diligence on one of the two candidates for president. So successful was the strategy that the Biden administration appears to have expanded it. Security agencies have switched their attention from combating foreign disinformation to censoring the speech of American citizens who dissent from the government-approved narrative. No matter that free speech is protected by the First Amendment; if the Biden administration doesn\u2019t like the speech, they label it \u201cMisinformation, Disinformation and Malformation,\u201d and they are deputizing the FBI and DHS to strong\u00adarm Big Tech to censor it and de-platform serial offenders. It doesn\u2019t matter what brand your politics is, this is Stasi stuff. DHS also recommended the use of third-party nonprofit groups as a \u201cclearing house for information to avoid the appearance of government propaganda,\u201d The Intercept reported. In the spy business, that is what is called a \u201ccutout,\u201d points out John Schindler, a former senior intelligence analyst with the National Security Agency. In other words, using a \u201cdeniable intermediary\u201d legally to spread the White House\u2019s propaganda. A perfect example of how the censorship regime works is the Hunter Biden laptop. Two FBI agents \u2014 Elvis Chan and Laura Dehmlow \u2014 have been identified in documents uncovered by the Missouri lawsuit as pressuring Facebook to suppress The Post\u2019s accurate and factual reporting. We know the FBI at the time was spying on Rudy Giuliani\u2019s online cloud with a covert surveillance warrant. Therefore, it had access to his emails in August 2020 from computer-store whistleblower John Paul Mac Isaac and to my text messages discussing when The Post would publish the story. It sure looks as if the FBI deliberately pre-censored a legitimate story for a political aim. An upcoming book by Mac Isaac, the owner of the now-defunct Delaware computer-repair shop where Hunter Biden abandoned his laptop in April 2019, sheds more light on this deep-state election interference. Mac Isaac, 46, is a patriot, and when he saw wrongdoing on the laptop, he felt it was his duty to bring it to the attention of the authorities. Unfortunately for him, he chose the FBI. In \u201cAmerican Injustice: My Battle to Expose the Truth,\u201d Mac Isaac says that \u201cat almost every step, I was met with skepticism, suspicion and even death threats. I feared for my life, not just in the face of angry strangers but in the face of a hostile FBI.\u201d His allegations are disturbing. Over the summer of 2019, the more Mac Isaac looked at the laptop, the more convinced he was that there were national security implications, especially in material relating to Ukraine. So he enlisted his father, retired Air Force Colonel Steve Mac Isaac, who took a copy of the laptop\u2019s hard drive on an external drive to the FBI\u2019s field office in Albuquerque, NM. He was treated with disdain. \u201cYou better lawyer up and don\u2019t talk to anyone about this,\u201d an FBI agent told him, according to the book. John Paul Mac Isaac\u2019s next chilling encounter with the FBI was six weeks later, on Nov. 21, 2019, when two agents, Joshua Wilson and Mike Dzielak, from the Baltimore field office went to his home and asked him questions about the laptop. \u201cHave you spoken with anyone else about this? Any other government or law-enforcement agencies?\u201d Then they left without taking the laptop. On Dec. 9, 2019, the agents arrived at his store with a subpoena and took the laptop and a hard-drive copy. As he left, Dzielak told Mac Isaac: \u201cIt is our experience that nothing ever happens to people that don\u2019t talk about these things.\u201d Mac Isaac felt unsettled. He was not reassured an hour later when Dzielak called him for technical help to access the drive. The laptop was never seen again. A few weeks later, just before Christmas, Dzielak phoned him again to ask if Hunter had come in asking for the laptop yet. Mac Isaac told him no but the agent \u201cseemed genuinely surprised, and that worried me.\u201d In May, 2020, convinced the FBI had buried the laptop, Mac Isaac and his father tried to contact Republican members of Congress, to no avail. Finally, on Aug. 26, 2020, Mac Isaac, found an email address for Rudy Giuliani, then Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, and wrote: Sign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine Please provide a valid email address.

Want even more news? \u201cFor almost a year I have been trying to get the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop to the proper authorities. I first reached out to the FBI and they came and collected it, but I have reason to believe they have destroyed it or buried it in a filing cabinet. After months of waiting for something to come of this, I can only assume that members of the FBI, who are against the President [Trump], have it and it will never be seen again. Luckily, for my protection, I made several copies and I have been trying quietly to bring it to people\u2019s attention.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for Mac Isaac\u2019s persistence and savvy, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop never would have seen the light of day, and America would be none the wiser about the FBI\u2019s nefarious role in covering it up. This year, whistleblowers have come forward to finger various FBI employees engaged in the cover-up. Timothy Thibault, the recently retired assistant special agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Washington, DC, field office, was the agency point man to manage Tony Bobulinski, Hunter\u2019s business partner who went to the FBI with evidence of the Biden influence-peddling operation. Thibault allegedly ordered the investigation closed and has refused to cooperate with GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee. If Republicans take back the House and the Senate in next week\u2019s midterm elections, their primary aim should be to investigate the censorship and cover-ups by the FBI, DHS and other federal agencies.

She said she was \u201cin the fetal position\u201d when the show\u2019s creator, Dan Schneider, came in to her dressing room. She alleged he gifted her a DVD player to get her to stop crying and finish filming. \u201cI remember looking around and going, \u2018Wow, nobody cares about what\u2019s happening to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel protected, and I don\u2019t feel safe. I\u2019m scared, and now I have to go back on set and pretend that nothing happened and have to be around those who did it to me.\u201d She said Schneider, as well as other Nickelodeon executives, later kicked her mom out of a meeting where Schneider allegedly asked, \u201cDo you understand that it\u2019s called \u2018Zoey 101\u2019 and not \u2018Nicole 101?'\u201d Schneider has been accused of misconduct and \u201csexualizing\u201d teens on Nickelodeon.

If you believe cop-killers should never be paroled, you should, too.", "content": "As a 32-year retired NYPD veteran, two recent stories concerning the department\u2019s Police Benevolent Association have me scratching my head. The PBA\u2019s decision to give Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul $25,000 to use in her campaign (almost said \u201creelection\u201d \u2014 but she was never elected) against Republican Lee Zeldin is beyond belief. The Post broke this story one day before it broke another, which noted the PBA is sounding the alarm on the eight New York City cop-killers up for parole in the next seven months. Am I alone in seeing the great dichotomy here? Hochul was Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor from January 2015 until replacing him when he resigned in August 2021. During their time in office, the Legislature, with the governor\u2019s support, changed state law and parole-board rules, making it easier for violent criminals to appeal parole denials. It\u2019s resulted, as the PBA said last year, in \u201c21 cop killers being turned loose by that panel in just over three years.\u201d The Less Is More law Hochul signed shortly after assuming office loosened parole rules and immediately released almost 200 criminals from Rikers Island. Zeldin\u2019s response to this was spot on. Hochul, he said , is \u201csiding with criminals over our men and women in blue and endangering the safety of every New Yorker.\u201d Zeldin promises, if elected, to \u201coverhaul\u201d the parole-board process, including requiring unanimous decisions when granting parole and establishing \u201ca process for victims and victims\u2019 families to appeal parole decisions.\u201d Imagine that: Having victims\u2019 advocates and law enforcement on the Board of Parole and replacing members \u201cwho have expressed poor judgment\u201d! Ideas like these are the reason Zeldin has overwhelming support from the law-enforcement and victims\u2019 rights communities. Has Hochul mentioned anything about fixing these problems should she be elected next week? Or is she \u201cwaiting for more data,\u201d like she\u2019s doing regarding the no-cash-bail fiasco that has the fear of becoming victim of a violent crime uppermost on New Yorkers\u2019 minds. That fear is real \u2014 and not, as Hochul just stated regarding her Republican opposition, \u201cthis conspiracy going all across America to convince people in Democratic states that they\u2019re not as safe.\u201d Kathy, the data on no-cash bail are very easy to read. They\u2019re written in red, in the blood innocent New Yorkers are leaving on the sidewalks, streets and subways of this city. Also note that one of Hochul\u2019s first acts as governor was appointing \u201cDefund the Police\u201d backer, subsequently indicted for bribery, Brian Benjamin lieutenant governor. Compare this with Zeldin\u2019s pick of highly respected former NYPD Deputy Inspector Alison Esposito as his running mate. Freeing cop-killers strikes a deep nerve with me. On Feb. 12, 1980, I was a cop assigned to the Street Crime Unit. We worked mostly 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. in plainclothes in the city\u2019s high-crime areas. That night, my partner and I made an arrest in Washington Heights shortly after leaving our Randall\u2019s Island base.

The lieutenant\u2019s next assignment for me is the reason cop-killers being paroled is such a sore subject for me, this many years later. \u201cI want you and Mo [Maureen DiStasio, a tremendous SCU detective in our squad] to pick up Monsignor Dunne [NYPD chaplain] and get out to Whitestone and make the notification to Bobby\u2019s wife.\u201d I will never forget ringing the bell of Cathy Bilodeau\u2019s house at 3 a.m. Seeing us and the monsignor in his white collar, she knew why we were there. It is every cop\u2019s spouse\u2019s worst nightmare. Maureen and I were assigned to the Bilodeau family through the wake and funeral. Every night, we shared with them the pain that this violent felon had inflicted upon the young widow and her children. I read some time ago about a Marine Corps casualty notification officer\u2019s technique when breaking the devastating news to a fallen Marine\u2019s family. \u201cWhen I pull up, I check to make sure I, with no doubt, have the right house.

Once they open the door and see me in my dress blues, their lives will never be the same.\u201d I know how that Marine feels. Bobby Bilodeau\u2019s killer was released from prison Jan. 12, 2021.

However, that answer might not come on election night because of how close some of the races are in key swing states. Liberal groups in Wisconsin seeking to change rules governing absentee ballots suffered a blow this week after an appeals court and a circuit judge ruled that ballots cannot contain partial addresses of witnesses. In an order Wednesday, Dane County Circuit Judge Juan Colas said there has been nearly 60 years of precedent to determine whether an absentee ballot has enough of a witness address to count. FILE: Wisconsin courts shoot down liberal attempts to change rules for absentee ballots (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File) In his order, Colas wrote that Wisconsin elections have been conducted for 56 years without a legally binding definition of what constitutes a witness address on a ballot. He said clerks have been legally free to interpret the term in good faith, drawing on non-binding guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, its predecessors, and advice from attorneys. Current guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission is that an address must include three elements: a street number, street name and municipality. Rise, Inc., a group that works to get young people to vote, argued that election clerks across Wisconsin are not consistently using that definition. MIDTERM STUDY FINDS MAINSTREAM MEDIA GAVE REPUBLICANS \u201887%\u2019 MORE NEGATIVE COVERAGE THAN DEMOCRATS The group sought an order that an address requires only enough information to determine the location of the witness. But Colas said it was inappropriate to issue an order that changes the status quo, rather than preserves it. In another other case, the 1st District Court of Appeals on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal of a ruling from Dane County Circuit Judge Nia Trammell rejecting a request from the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin seeking a ruling that an address can only be missing when the entire field is left blank. Video The appeals court said it would not hear the case because it did not meet criteria for granting an appeal. Trammell said that loosening the witness address requirement \"would upend the status quo and not preserve it\" and \"frustrate the electoral process by causing confusion.\" The rulings come within days of next week\u2019s midterms and as more than 503,000 absentee ballots have already either been returned or cast in person.

Marks is about to hire yet another coach , and the leading candidate is a man serving a yearlong suspension imposed by the very team that swept the Nets out of last year\u2019s playoffs. You can\u2019t make it up, and you never have to make it up when it involves the Nets. On a day when they finally got something right with the announcement that the team and Kyrie Irving will each donate $500,000 to causes opposing hate and intolerance , and with Irving\u2019s admission that he erred in posting a link to an anti-Semitic film , the Nets still dribbled themselves into a dangerous corner. In the wake of Steve Nash\u2019s firing, they are reportedly prepared to hire former Nash assistant and suspended Celtics head coach Ime Udoka . You are aware that Udoka was benched by the Celtics for the entire 2022-23 season for engaging in an improper relationship with a female subordinate and, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, for using \u201ccrude language\u201d with that subordinate before the start of the relationship. The Nets have gambled before with a lot of people, starting with Kevin Durant\u2019s chosen sidekick, Irving, who wasn\u2019t happy playing with one of the two greatest NBA players of all time (LeBron James), or playing for one of the two greatest NBA franchises of all time (the Celtics). They gambled on a coach with no experience, Nash, and on James Harden and Ben Simmons, two stars who, along with Irving, reconfigured the definition of \u201chigh maintenance.\u201d The Nets lost all of those gambles. Chances are they would lose this one, too. They are trying to clean up their own mess by borrowing from someone else\u2019s mess, never a good idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a shotgun marriage,\u201d said former Nets executive and current ESPN analyst Bobby Marks, no relation to Sean. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Are Boston\u2019s ethics and standards of workplace conduct higher than Brooklyn\u2019s?\u201d The answer is painfully obvious. Sean Marks and owner Joe Tsai are apparently ready to sign off on the hiring of a coach whose in-house conduct was reckless enough to earn a tougher punishment than Latrell Sprewell ultimately got (68 games) for choking P.J. Carlesimo in 1997. Do you think the Celtics really wanted to banish a rookie coach who had just led them to The Finals? So yes, that\u2019s what they thought of Udoka\u2019s actions. It\u2019s hard to believe NBA commissioner Adam Silver would allow anyone under a season-long suspension to take a backdoor cut to a fresh start with any team, never mind a division rival, mere weeks into the penalty. But that\u2019s the way this is apparently going down. Wednesday night, the Nets sent out a statement disclosing their million-dollar partnership with Irving \u2014 and their commitment to work with the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 to combat the kind of hate that Irving himself had endorsed. The point guard finally said he is \u201caware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community\u201d and maintained that he doesn\u2019t believe \u201ceverything said in the documentary was true or reflects my morals and principals.\u201d So be it. But as an organization long guided by a wayward moral compass, the Nets should now be concerned about the message that Udoka\u2019s hiring would send to their right-minded employees and supporters, and especially to women. It seems the Nets are only concerned about trying to save a superstar-centric concept that is already broken beyond repair. \u201cThe Durant-Irving experiment is over,\u201d Bobby Marks said. \u201cI would just wipe the slate clean and start over.\u201d But the Nets are too desperate to do anything that sensible. With virtually no chance of giving Irving another big contract during next summer\u2019s free agency, the Nets want to heave up one final Hail Mary pass. Sean Marks knows he will get fired before Tsai lets him start a rebuild, so what the hell, why not take a crazy shot at Udoka and hope to get really lucky? And from a purely basketball standpoint, Udoka is a major upgrade on Nash. A Hall-of-Fame point guard, Nash could never earn Irving\u2019s respect. One league source witnessed Nash stomping his feet and shooting an angry look at Irving during last week\u2019s loss to Dallas for breaking a called play. The fire is best described as much too little, much too late. Udoka showed no fear in coaching the Celtics, publicly questioning their mental toughness before they responded to him in a big way. His Nets would play defense and get physical like Nash\u2019s Nets never did. At the same time, Udoka\u2019s ability to lead has been severely compromised. What happens when the new coach tries to rebuke a player, and that player decides he shouldn\u2019t have to listen to someone who got himself suspended for a full year? In the end, if he hires Udoka, Sean Marks will likely say that he knows the full character of the man from their time together in San Antonio and Brooklyn, and that Udoka\u2019s mistakes in Boston were thoroughly vetted. But it\u2019s never been wise to take the Nets at their word. They take a lot of gambles, and they have a great talent for losing them.", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-16.03851318359375, -5.06981897354126]}, {"title": "Nancy Pelosi seen leaving San Francisco house days after David DePape allegedly attacked her husband", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/nancy-pelosi-seen-leaving-san-francisco-house-days-after-david-depape-allegedly-attacked-husband", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen on Sunday leaving her San Francisco house days after her husband, Paul Pelosi, was injured during a home break-in.", "content": "close Video First day in court for Paul Pelosi hammer attack suspect California Attorney General candidate Nathan Hochman shares his insight on the suspect for Paul Pelosi\u2019s case his first day on trial on \u2018Fox News @ Night.\u2019 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen leaving her San Francisco house days after her husband was severely injured during a home-break in.

According to documents reviewed by NBC News, West, who now goes by Ye, paid the former worker who claimed the musician complimented Hitler or Nazis. West denied the claims in the settlement, the outlet reported. Multiple people who worked with West or dealt with him in professional settings over the last five years told NBC News that he brought up conspiracy theories about Jewish people and spoke positively about the disgraced Nazi dictator. Three ex-employees or collaborators reportedly said there were numerous instances when he used anti-Semitic language and another three people discussed a 2018 incident when West went on an anti-Semitic rant while at TMZ\u2019s offices.

Earthstorm recounts the experiences of the people who got up close and personal with that power.", "content": "Earthstorm (Netflix) is a four-episode docuseries that takes a look at severe weather events and natural disasters from the perspective of people who\u2019ve experienced them up close: storm chasers, first responders, researchers, and survivors. The series visits the US, Iceland, Italy, Japan as its episodes each tackle a specific event, from tornadoes and volcanoes to earthquakes and hurricanes, and Earthstorm features narration from Mimi M. Khayisa, who plays Fringilla Vigo on Netflix\u2019s The Witcher. Opening Shot: A reporter is heard over night time footage of a tornado on the horizon, plate glass storefronts shattered by wind, and an aerial shot of a factory building reduced to tinder. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation catastrophic tornado. You\u2019ve got to get to your safe place. Now.\u201d The Gist: As Mimi M. Khaysia tells us in voiceover, there are 1200 tornadoes annually in the United States. That\u2019s four times more than the rest of the world combined, and as persistent warming of the climate continues, their zones of frequency are becoming less distinct and more all-encompassing. \u201cTornado Alley\u201d out on the Great Plains and \u201cDixie Alley\u201d \u2013 a swath of tornado activity that follows the Gulf Coast through Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama \u2013 are actually merging into one big trouble spot, because as the climate warms it creates the potential for and almost the certainty of even more catastrophic storms. That means more work for Brandon Clement and Brett Adair. The storm chasing duo make their living licensing footage of the severe weather events they capture, and they drive into the thick of danger with an eye on the horizon. \u201cTornado Time is what I call it,\u201d Clement says, \u201cin the afternoons in the Plains, that five o\u2019clock to eight o\u2019clock hour, that\u2019s where you get most of your tornadoes.\u201d The film follows the duo as they\u2019re lured by tornadoes\u2019 terrible beauty, which of course is concurrent with their potential for destructive power. In Spring 2021, Clement is in position in Texas to capture the formation of a tornado. A storm might only last for a minute or less, and he needs to be ready with his drone cam. But that also means he\u2019s on site before first responders can get to anyone injured. \u201cIt always amazes me how something so beautiful can do so much damage.\u201d And Earthstorm captures a moment where the slithering miles-long finger of a diminishing funnel cloud follows the contours of an emerging rainbow. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? In the first episode of Earthstorm , crisply-rendered and informative animation illustrates the grand scale connectivity between geographical features and wind and weather patterns that produces tornadoes in the Great Plains region, and that got us thinking about Connected , Netflix\u2019s science docuseries hosted by Latif Nasser of NPR\u2019s Radiolab that expands the relevance of stuff like dust and clouds on how we interact with the environment. Our Take: It\u2019s one thing to consider the magnitude of the destruction wrought by the worst tornadoes to strike, to see the vast channel of debris that the biggest storms on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale cut through neighborhoods, towns, and networks of highways. But Earthstorm also lets these events broadcast their almost inescapable vastness with some incredible footage. A 2013 tornado that formed in the skies above Oklahoma, where one funnel cloud became two and then three funnels before seeming to envelope the entire horizon as one monstrous tornado. \u201cThe chase is an adrenaline rush,\u201d storm chaser Brett Adair says at one point. \u201cMy passion is to be in violent weather.\u201d But it seems like the most important moment of their endeavors to track and capture these events is understanding when the threshold between adrenaline and survival has been reached and to listen when their inner voice starts screaming to bug out. And some of them aren\u2019t so lucky, with that 2013 storm having taken the lives of three storm chasers. But Earthstorm is conscious of keeping its focus on the profound power of these tornadoes, and how the chasers must always reckon with that even as they strive to document it with their cameras and drones. Sex and Skin: None. Parting Shot: As Brett Adair considers the damage of the EF4 tornado that hit Mayfield, Kentucky, threatening music portends the realities of climate change and the increased threat of super storm events. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says. \u201cMayfield is not unique. It\u2019s just the latest city to be hit by a tornado. There will be more. It makes you feel kind of vulnerable, never knowing when that tornado is going to come your way.\u201d His implication? That it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when. Sleeper Star: Breeana Glisson\u2019s account of how she and her two young children survived the catastrophic tornado that slammed into western Kentucky in 2021 really resonates. Unable to evacuate because nowhere safe was reachable, Glisson gripped her kids as tightly as possible as her house was destroyed all around her and the force of the storm tossed them hundreds of yards through the air. Most Pilot-y Line: Howard Bluestein of the University of Oklahoma\u2019s Advanced Radar Research Center (ARRC) explains the dynamic of a tornado\u2019s formation with professorial clarity as revealing animation merges with a storm in the physical world. \u201cThe source of the rotation of the tornado is the horizontal row that occurs along the boundary between the cool air where rain has fallen and evaporated, and the regular warm moist air that\u2019s just outside the storm. That\u2019s where the spin comes from. That air which is spinning approaches the updraft, the main buoyant updraft in the storm, and it gets tilted up. And lo and behold, you have a low level mesocyclone.\u201d Our Call: STREAM IT. The human element of Earthstorm is compelling, from the chasers who are drawn to the tornadoes\u2019 volatility to the survivors who dust themselves off and turn to help a neighbor. But it\u2019s the storms themselves that are the star of this show, as they spread across the screen in their frightful magnitude, and animations illustrate the atmospheric and geologic factors that lead to their formation.

Wtf!!!!\u201d one Twitter user exclaimed . \u201cI was today years old when I learned that women\u2019s shirts have buttons on the left side!\u201d wrote another. So what gives? There are a few theories that date back ages. One goes that wealthy women didn\u2019t dress themselves \u2014 they had servants do it for them. Assuming that most people are right-handed, the buttons on women\u2019s clothes were sewn so that someone else could fasten them. \u201cWhy women\u2019s shirts button from the left, while men\u2019s button from the right: When buttons first appeared in the 17th century, they were only for the wealthy. Women were dressed by (right-handed) servants. Placing buttons on the left made it easier for them,\u201d one author tweeted , along with a photo of a passage from \u201cThe Economic Naturalist: In Search of Explanations for Everyday Enigmas.\u201d Why women's shirts button from the left, while men's button from the right: When buttons first appeared in the 17th century, they were only for the wealthy. Women were dressed by (right-handed) servants. Placing buttons on the left made it easier for them https://t.co/79wlVJlLPg pic.twitter.com/8bKkmTnaDR In 2016, fashion historian Chloe Chapin informed the \u201cToday\u201d show about button placement. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to question which time period we\u2019re talking about, since shirt and jacket buttons are a relatively new phenomenon,\u201d Chapin said . \u201cBut as a general rule, many elements of men\u2019s fashion can be traced back to the military.\u201d Assuming most men were right-handed, putting buttons on the right side allowed better \u201caccess to a weapon,\u201d which \u201cpractically trumped everything,\u201d she explained, adding that a gun hidden in a shirt would be easier to grab with the dominant hand. Another theory, Chapin offered, is that button placement distinguished women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothing at a time when that mattered. Women\u2019s outfits became more \u201cmasculine\u201d in the 1880s, but it was still \u201cillegal\u201d to be \u201cdressed like a man in public.\u201d Other theories revolve around the need to breastfeed and care for a child. According to Southern Living , clothing-makers, again, assumed most women were right-handed and would be carrying infants in their left arm. If they needed to breastfeed, they could use their right hand to unbutton their shirts. An Elle article noted an unconfirmed theory that Napoleon was offended that people would mock his hand-in-coat stance, ordering that women\u2019s clothing be buttoned the opposite of men\u2019s so they wouldn\u2019t mimic him. Or, of course, it could just be out-right gender inequality. The fact that women\u2019s clothing buttoned opposite of men\u2019s was a sign of inferiority, according to the 19th century sexologist Havelock Ellis. The assumption at the time was that women were weaker and required more assistance, hence, the commonplace need for handmaids dressing them every day. By buttoning their clothing on the left, women would \u201cseem inferior to men\u201d in \u201cstrength and in rapidity and precision of movement.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-03", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [2.5920145511627197, -2.5920281410217285]}, {"title": "Jets\u2019 defense faces big test versus Josh Allen and Bills\u2019 dynamic offense", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/02/jets-defense-faces-big-test-vs-bills-and-josh-allen/", "description": "Sunday\u2019s game is a measuring stick to see how much the Jets have closed the gap with the current kings of the AFC East.", "content": "The Jets have not beaten the Bills since the season finale in 2019. Buffalo has outscored them 117-54 in the past four games. The Jets lost 45-17 and 27-10 in head-to-head battles last year. The gap between the two teams never felt wider than after that final game last season, when the Jets\u2019 season ended and the Bills prepared for a playoff run. Now, they meet again. \u201cProbably the most complete football team we\u2019ll see all season,\u201d Jets coach Robert Saleh said. Yes, the 6-1 Bills might be the best team in football. If they are not the best, they are in the top three. Sunday\u2019s game is a measuring stick to see how much the Jets have closed the gap with the current kings of the AFC East. It is a test for the defense in particular. The Jets have made huge leaps on that side of the ball this year. After ranking dead last a season ago, they enter this one sixth in yards against, averaging 311.4 yards allowed. But the Bills\u2019 offense is by far the best one the Jets have seen this season. Buffalo enters this game first in total offense (430.6 yards per game), first in passing offense (307.7) and second in scoring offense (27.7 points per game). If the Jets\u2019 defense wants to show it\u2019s for real, it needs to slow down these high-powered Bills. \u201cThey present a huge challenge,\u201d rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner said. \u201cHaving a lot of weapons at receiver, having a quarterback that can throw the ball and do it with his legs, having a great running back \u2014 they present a huge challenge. But I feel like we have what it takes with the guys here.\u201d It starts with quarterback Josh Allen. He leads the NFL with 21 total touchdowns and is equally dangerous with his arm and his legs. He has thrown for 2,198 yards and 19 touchdowns this season. He has run for 306 yards and two touchdowns. The 2018 first-round pick is an MVP candidate and has answered all of the questions surrounding him when he was in the draft. \u201cHe\u2019s like huge,\u201d Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s like 6-[foot]-5 I think, can stiff-arm, can run the ball, can jump, can hurdle. He\u2019s basically like a running back who can throw the ball real good. He\u2019s an elite quarterback. When he has to throw a deep ball, he has an elite arm. He\u2019s a super-powerful quarterback. Going against him is going to be a big challenge.\u201d Allen has a strong supporting cast around him. Stefon Diggs has a franchise-record 55 receptions through seven games. To put that in perspective, it is 21 more catches than Jets leading receiver Garrett Wilson has in one less game. Gardner said he would \u201cmost definitely\u201d like to follow Diggs on Sunday, but that is not something Saleh\u2019s defense usually does. It will be interesting to see if the Jets feel like this week should be an exception. D.J. Reed has played well opposite Gardner, so the Jets may just play sides. The Bills also have a strong No. 2 receiver in Gabe Davis, who has 418 yards receiving. \u201cThe quarterback is a cog to a bigger machine: The more you surround them with great players, the better he\u2019ll get,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cStefon is one of the best in football, excellent route-runner, violence, plays with intensity, plays with swag, so he\u2019s really good. Gabe is just a big, big body and then their backs are all really good, out of the backfield, tight ends really good, O-line does a nice job. So, he\u2019s surrounded by the right pieces, and you take a guy like Josh who\u2019s already, by himself, fantastic, it just makes for a really good offense.\u201d The Jets\u2019 defense carried the team during its four-game winning streak and can do it again by containing Allen and Co. \u201cWe have to be physical,\u201d defensive end John Franklin-Myers said. \u201cWe have to be violent.

But Nick Gates won.", "content": "The Giants lost at Seattle on Sunday. But Nick Gates won. Thirteen months after he suffered a gruesome shattered tibia and fibula in his left leg in a Week 2 game against Washington last season, the 26-year-old offensive lineman not only returned to the Giants\u2019 active roster Sunday for the first time since enduring seven surgeries, but he played in the game . Gates\u2019 first play back was in the goal-line jumbo package, where from the left side of the line he sealed off Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin, nearly plowing him into the first row of the stands while running back Saquon Barkley scored the Giants only touchdown of the game. After the play, as he lay on his back on the turf Gates kicked his legs into the air in a child-like celebration as if it was he who crossed the goal line with the football in his hands. And up in the nosebleed seats at Lumen Field \u2014 Section 313, Row FF to be exact \u2014 tears flowed. That\u2019s where Gates\u2019 mother, Sonja, along with his older brother, Matt, and a slew of cousins, nieces and nephews sat for the game. Sonja Gates, who traveled from her home in Las Vegas to experience the moment, told The Post she didn\u2019t care if Nick got to play in the game or not, that she was there to merely see him in uniform again. That, in her mind, represented a monumental victory. \u201cMy whole goal coming here was so I could be here to watch him run on that field in a uniform ready to play if he gets that opportunity,\u2019\u2019 Sonja said. \u201cAfter the long 13 months he\u2019s gone through with the physical pain, the emotional pain, for us to be there and watch him walk out on that field, that\u2019s all we care about. \u201cWould we love to see him play? Absolutely, because I know that\u2019s what he wants to do.\u2019\u2019 Gates got in for two plays in the jumbo package. \u201cJust seeing him run out onto that field was my dream come true,\u2019\u2019 Sonja said. \u201cBut for Nick I know that getting out there to play again was his dream. And what more can you ask for than to see your children\u2019s dreams come true?\u2019\u2019 Sonja said she\u2019s never seen her son\u2019s injury. She was unable to connect and stream the Giants-Washington game that fateful day. \u201cI think it was God\u2019s way of protecting me,\u2019\u2019 Sonja said. \u201cI still have not seen a replay of the injury. I refuse to watch it.\u2019\u2019 She immediately flew to the Virginia hospital where Nick underwent the first of his seven surgeries and stayed with him for the two weeks while he was in the hospital. Then she accompanied him back to New Jersey and stayed with him for two months during the early part of his recovery. \u201cMy first worry was that he was going to lose his leg,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI wanted him to have a leg and to be able to play with his children when he has them. Football was not foremost on my mind. It was on his. Every doctor we saw, every time he saw a doctor, that was his first question: \u2018Am I going to be able to play football again?\u2019 \u201cNick is very physically strong. So I knew physically he was going to be OK. But to have that snatched away from him in a second, that was hard. He was undrafted and he fought his way to where he\u2019d gotten. And for that to happen, it was really hard. \u201cBut when Nick puts his mind to something, there\u2019s no stopping him. He never lost sight of what he wanted to do.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s what made Sunday in Seattle so powerful. Before the game, Nick met with Sonja, Matt and the rest of the family, taking pictures with each of the nieces and nephews. \u201cWe were crying with him down on the field before the game; it was very emotional,\u2019\u2019 Matt told The Post. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen my brother cry twice,\u2019\u2019 Nick Gates told The Post after the game. \u201cOne of them was [Sunday] and the other one was when I broke my leg. Before that, I can never remember seeing him cry. I was definitely happy to have him there. \u201cI relied on him and my mom a lot mentally and emotionally. It was good to have them there in the stands to see my first snaps back. It means a lot to them and it means a lot to me. It was a special moment.\u2019\u2019 A week after Gates was voted by his teammates as a team captain last fall, as he lay on that field in Maryland, his season was wrecked and his career in doubt. \u201cIt was very difficult, because the stars were lining up for him last year,\u2019\u2019 Matt said. \u201cHe came in undrafted, he ends up starting, he gets named captain and then he has that horrific injury. I feel like last year was kind of robbed from him. \u201cHe\u2019ll do it again; I know he will. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. People say he\u2019s lucky. He\u2019s not lucky. He\u2019s hard-nosed, grind, grind, grind. He\u2019s earned everything he\u2019s gotten. Coming back is a testament to his mental toughness.\u2019\u2019 Gates is no longer a team captain by title, but he\u2019s still viewed that way by his teammates. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader on this team still,\u2019\u2019 Barkley said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s been through and the way that he\u2019s worked \u2014 he never gave up.

However, the drive to get rich off a winning ticket has a dark side, critics say, arguing that state-run lotteries often negatively impact low-income and minority groups. \"State lotteries are the most neglected example of systemic racism in the United States than any other issue or problem, I should say, in our country,\" said Les Bernal, the National Director for Stop Predatory Gambling, an advocacy nonprofit organization, in an interview with NPR. Bernal says that, through marketing and advertising, state-run lotteries have no regulation to their \"predatory practices\" that affect low-income communities \u2014 which are made up of primarily Black and brown people. \"There are people who do develop unhealthy relationships with the lottery and they develop a gambling use disorder,\" said Timothy Fong, co-director of the Gambling Studies Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"There's a tremendous amount of advertising and marketing that's pro-lottery. Even on my Twitter feeds, I see this a lot...you know, very positive messaging that comes with it,\" he added.

Terrill/AP hide caption Maher Diab holds up cash before buying lottery tickets at Bluebird Liquor, Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, in Hawthorne, Calif. Saturday's jackpot projected winnings of an estimated $825 million is the fifth-highest in U.S. history. Over recent years, enormous jackpots for lottery games like Powerball and Mega Millions have become the norm, as lottery officials adjusted game rules and ticket prices this year for its players, according to The Associated Press . The most recent change took place in August when Powerball officials added an additional drawing day in order to build larger prizes and boost sales. But with the game implementing new changes and more drawings weekly, communities of color and low-income communities are continuing to become the subject of predatory gambling. Research shows that, in 2021 alone, Americans spent nearly $105 billion on lottery tickets \u2014 with the average adult in the U.S. spending roughly $320 a year on tickets. In a nationwide investigation of state lotteries by the Howard Center for Investigation Journalism at the University of Maryland , researchers found that state lottery retailers are disproportionately grouped in lower-income communities. And in some states, studies show these retailers exist primarily in Black and Latino neighborhoods. \"What we're talking about are gambling industry practices that are clearly designed to take advantage of vulnerable or adverse communities,\" Fong said. Fong, who studies the clinical characteristics of gambling disorders, says in order to combat the issue of predatory gambling, government regulators must first address the question of who \u2014 whether it's retailers or the states \u2014 is responsible for stopping practices that target vulnerable communities. \"Why are you selling a potentially addictive product that we know doesn't generate wealth and income for anybody?\" Fong said. \"Should there be caps on that?\" When introduced to Americans, the original premise of state-run lotteries was marketed to raise funds for education \u2014 such as K-12, college or both. A few states use their lottery revenue for other things like road and park maintenance, according to the American Institute for Economic Research . However, the Howard Center's investigation discovered that the promise of state lotteries supporting education doesn't quite match up. Instead, the lotteries often create inequities by \"disproportionately benefiting\" college students and wealthier school districts far from the neighborhoods where lottery tickets are sold, the Howard Center reported. \"Poor people are collateral damage to a cause of raising money for what the legislators feel is good purposes ... public safety, local schools,\" Gregory W. Sullivan, former Massachusetts inspector general and now research director for the Pioneer Institute, told the Howard Center. Bernal agrees. \"You have low-income people, essentially paying for college scholarships for middle-class and upper-class families to go to college.

CAROL SWAIN: We have known that, you know, for many decades, that the affirmative action as practiced in this country violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. And we have been willing as a nation to tolerate the discriminatory behavior because it was thought that it was temporary, and that eventually it would be eliminated. But what we find with the CRT and DEI and the move away from nondiscrimination to open discrimination, the open discrimination we see against Whites and Asians taking place, it is time for the court to step in and restore the law and the Constitution.

The Celtics\u2019 deadly proficiency from long range all night long certainly had the opposite effect on the helpless Knicks and the stunned Garden faithful. Boston\u2019s sharpshooters connected for a franchise-record 27 3-pointers \u2014 also setting the mark for treys allowed by the Knicks \u2014 to crush Tom Thibodeau\u2019s team, 133-118. Jaylen Brown had 30 points and Jayson Tatum contributed 26 \u2014 with six 3-pointers apiece \u2014 for the Celtics, who fired their way to a whopping 52.9 percent efficiency (27-for-51) from beyond the arc. The barrage also broke the previous Knicks record for 3-pointers allowed of 26, the Bucks\u2019 total in a game at the Garden in November 2021. The Knicks had given up 23 last Sunday in a loss to Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers in Cleveland. Randle (29 points) and Barrett (27) managed season-high scoring totals, and Jalen Brunson finished with 22 points and 10 assists for the Knicks (4-5). Isaiah Hartenstein made his first start of the season for the Knicks in place of banged-up center Mitchell Robinson (knee) and scored 10 points with a team-best 14 rebounds over 38 minutes. Evan Fournier was out of the starting lineup for a second straight game, one night after Quentin Grimes had replaced him with the first five in a comeback win in Philadelphia. With Grimes (foot soreness) held out Saturday because it was the second night of a back-to-back, Thibodeau chose to start Cam Reddish (four points) at shooting guard, leaving Fournier with the second unit. The Celtics, who improved to 6-3 this season under interim coach Joe Mazzulla, drained five of their first six attempts from long distance \u2014 including two by Tatum \u2014 in the first 3:34 for a quick 15-5 lead. But Reddish sparked the Knicks at the defensive end with a key steal, and they rattled off 10 points in a row \u2014 featuring two 3s by Randle \u2014 to even the score. A pick-6 style steal and dunk by Immanuel Quickley, seven points in five minutes from Derrick Rose, rejections by Obi Toppin and third-string center Jericho Sims and a 3-pointer in the closing seconds by Fournier kept the Knicks within 32-29 through one quarter. With big men Al Horford (rest) and Robert Williams (knee) out for the Celtics, Thibodeau again turned to the smaller lineup, with a combo of Randle and Toppin, for part of the second quarter. But Boston kept firing from long range, netted the first nine points of the session and opened a 53-39 lead on Sam Hauser\u2019s corner trey with 7:40 left before halftime. It was his fourth long-range connection of the half. The Knicks\u2019 makeshift starting unit got them back in the game by intermission. Barrett buried two 3s and scored 13 points, while Randle added seven points in a 27-14 splurge to close out the half for a 67-66 Celtics advantage through 24 minutes. Boston added to its halftime total of 13 made 3s with eight more in the third quarter, extending the lead to 101-96 entering the final period. Additional long-range bombs by Marcus Smart (13 points, 11 assists) and former Knick Noah Vonleh boosted the Boston lead to nine midway through the fourth. A traditional three-point conversion by Randle cut the Knicks\u2019 deficit back to four, but Tatum set the Celtics\u2019 franchise record with their 25th and 26th 3-pointers of the night for a 124-114 game with 3:34 remaining.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-19.11479949951172, -3.639394760131836]}, {"title": "Army vet Steven Paul Criss busted for 1974 execution-style slaying of two teenage boys", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/steven-paul-criss-arrested-for-killing-two-teens-50-years-ago/", "description": "A 65-year-old man who killed his Army commanding officer over a disagreement was arrested for the 1974 slaying of two teenage boys.", "content": "An Army vet who once did time for killing a commanding officer was arrested for a decades-old double murder of two teenage boys in Oregon, officials said. Steven Paul Criss, now 65, allegedly gunned down 16-year-old Donny Bartron and 18-year-old Pete Zito, Jr. in an execution-style shooting in a rec center parking lot in 1974, cops said this week. The boys\u2019 bodies were found the following morning by an Oregonian newspaper delivery driver. Barton had been working on the engine of a 1956 Oldsmobile when he was shot. His body was found slumped over under the open hood. Zito was found lying on the ground next to the driver\u2019s door. \u201cBoth teens had been shot multiple times in the head with a .22 caliber gun,\u201d case lead Det. Mark Povolny said at a Friday press conference. Criss and Barton were coworkers at the Black Angus restaurant in Hillsboro, but did not get along, police said. Although officers knew Criss \u201chad reason to be upset with Donnie,\u201d for which they could not disclose, they pursued another suspect. Joseph Amir Wilson was arrested and charged with the double murder, but continuously pleaded innocence. Wilson allegedly assaulted another individual at the recreational center a few hours before Bartron and Zito were killed and officers believed Wilson shot the boys in a case of \u201cmistaken identity.\u201d He was later released without conviction. Criss became a suspect after the sheriff\u2019s office arrested him for theft two months after the murder and found a .22 caliber gun inside his car, Povolny said. After testing, however, the cops couldn\u2019t match the gun to the murder scene. The gun was returned to Criss, who then took it with him to the Fort Lewis United States Army base in Washington and used it to kill his commanding officer, Sgt. Jacob Kim Brown, nearly two years to the date that Barton and Zito were killed. The cadet shot his boss in the head five times over an argument, police said. Criss had damaged Brown\u2019s car and killed him instead of paying for repairs. Criss was sentenced to 35 years in jail but was released after 12. Washington County sheriffs decided to reopen the double-murder case 48 years later and re-run ballistics on the gun Criss used to kill Brown. This time, it was a match. Criss, who had been living in Iowa, was arrested and charged with two counts of second-degree murder, the department said. \u201cMr. Criss was taken into custody using the same pair of handcuffs used when deputies arrested him in December 1974,\u201d Povolny said.

DeSantis dismissed rumors of a rift between him and Trump earlier this year saying that Trump is a \"friend of mine.\" \"He wants to see Republicans doing well,\" DeSantis told Fox News in February. \"And I think when media is trying to act like he's upset at me for doing well, I think that's total bunk.

A presidential straw poll at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit found that 78.7% of attendees favored Trump to be the Republican nominee in 2024.

A former colleague working in real estate volunteers that he\u2019s backing Zeldin \u201cbecause this isn\u2019t the Democratic Party I signed up for.\u201d Another Dem, a former top New York official, writes: \u201cFor the first time in my life, I just voted the straight Republican ticket for New York state. The Democratic Party has lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent.\u201d These are the voices of a potential earthquake. One by one and in small groups, formerly loyal Dems are coming to the conclusion that the party they were proud to belong to no longer shares their interests and values. Many cite the left\u2019s relentless assault on convention and standards, and the effort to silence disagreement. Every institution is either under attack or has capitulated to the woke mob, turning liberals into conservatives. The working and middle classes in whose name this revolution is being carried out are suffering the most from its excesses and now they, too, demand relief. That many are voting Republican explains why a red wave is forming across the nation and in even the bluest of states. Something has to give \u2014 and it could be Kathy Hochul\u2019s job. On paper, the accidental governor and her party enjoy a 2-1 registration edge. But when things are bad enough, reality trumps party, and it is a testament to how high crime has climbed and how far the quality of life has fallen that Zeldin is on the cusp of being the first Republican elected governor in 20 years. He is a Long Island congressman and former state senator, but the smart set considered him a long shot even after he won a contested primary in June. But Zeldin has proved a dogged campaigner and outworked Hochul, who foolishly allowed him to define the race while she took victory for granted and hid behind routine government appearances. In her absence, the challenger has relentlessly hammered Hochul\u2019s tenure on crime and disorder and laid out an ambitious agenda for public safety that involves removing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and suspending criminal-coddling bail laws. The trend has been Zeldin\u2019s friend, with each day bringing fresh evidence that both the city and state are in a free-fall. Violent crime, combined with failing schools and a suffocating tax and regulation regime, are pushing record numbers of people to flee the Vampire State. Polls have tightened, and some call the race a toss-up. One result is that, while Hochul built a huge cash firewall, Zeldin is getting enough financial support to be competitive on television.

Yet, truth be told, it is largely Hochul\u2019s strange and feckless response to his charges that is giving the challenger his biggest boost. Emerging belatedly from the Rose Garden, she still offers no clear or forceful answer to his overarching theme of danger and decline. To this day, she continues to flirt with the ridiculous idea that crime isn\u2019t as bad as Zeldin says, which is tantamount to telling people that what they see isn\u2019t true and their fears are groundless. She calls Republicans \u201cmanipulators\u201d and talks of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d driving the issue. When a Buffalo mother was killed by a man who had earlier been arrested for beating her and then released, Hochul blamed \u201cthe system.\u201d Even Friday, she was telling CNN her opponent is \u201cbeing dishonest.\u201d That\u2019s her story and she\u2019s sticking to it, and at this late date, we should take her at her word: she doesn\u2019t believe crime is a serious problem in the city or the state. If she did, she has had endless opportunities to say so and do something about it. Instead, she acts as if she\u2019s the victim of an unfair attack. Woe is her. Her mishandling of Public Enemy No. 1 raises two other features of her performance. She doesn\u2019t appear to have a great passion for the job, nor does she display evidence of any special competence. Recall that she became governor in August of 2021 when Andrew Cuomo resigned after multiple sexual-harassment charges were substantiated by investigators appointed by the attorney general. Until that moment, Hochul was viewed as impeachment insurance, meaning Cuomo was not likely to be removed because few people considered Hochul qualified for the job in her own right. But Cuomo became so toxic that concerns about Hochul\u2019s fitness were brushed aside. Now those concerns are front and center again, and not just on crime. She has proven to be no match for the Legislature, which steamrolled her on an extravagantly wasteful budget and gave her almost nothing in return. Most telling, the Dems in charge ignored appeals by her and Mayor Adams to change the notorious bail laws. The one area where Hochul showed an independent streak \u2014 economic development \u2014 is revealing her to be a flawed steward of taxpayers\u2019 money. Her gift of $600 million of state funds to the Buffalo Bills for a new stadium was such a lopsided deal that she has tried in part to justify the giveaway with the absurd claim that state taxes on high player salaries would repay the cost over 20 years. Similarly, state subsidies reportedly totaling $5.5 billion for Micron to build an upstate chip factory work out to more than $600,000 per job \u2014 if Micron creates 9,000 jobs over several decades. If it doesn\u2019t, the cost per job would increase. There is also wide skepticism about her administration\u2019s claim the deal will lead to 42,000 new private jobs in the area. It\u2019s no wonder Hochul needs outside political help, and she will end the race by appearing variously with President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Bill and Hillary Clinton. The fact that she has to rely on them to get out the vote reveals how little enthusiasm she generates on her own. Meanwhile, her attacks on Zeldin are mostly about his pro-life position and Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of him, along with Zeldin\u2019s Jan. 6 vote to decertify some 2020 state results. Regarding abortion, New York law already offers far more extensive protections than Roe v. Wade did. Zeldin concedes the point and is trying to take the topic off the table by saying he cannot change the law and won\u2019t try. Polling also shows that for many Dems and most independents, abortion and Trump are not nearly as important as inflation, the economy, crime and border security. Because the election is likely to turn on those issues and because she has such a spotty track record, voters should ask themselves this crucial question: what would New York get if Hochul keeps her job?

All the episodes that Disney chose not to air involved sex or drinking.

He said that Jacobs was worried about the scene since he had read that hepatitis could spread through sharing razors. \"Boy Meets World\" ran for seven seasons on ABC from 1993 to 2000.

However, despite just six races in his career, Flightline may very well have run his final race on Saturday. The L.A. Times notes that breeding rights could approach $100 million for the horse.

Kathy Hochul might yet pull off a narrow victory on Tuesday, but her campaign is visibly running on fumes and focused exclusively (and lamely ) on imploring the Democratic base to bother voting. She\u2019s doing mostly indoor events, largely in the city (where early-voting turnout has been conspicuously low) staged by party regulars and in union halls. The sparse turnouts are alarming party leaders. Challenger Lee Zeldin, meanwhile, is holding huge and happy outdoor rallies \u2014 and continuing his practice of visiting crime scenes, such as the site of Thursday\u2019s horrific rape of a woman jogger on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, allegedly by a vagrant with 25 priors who police are also eyeing in two previous rapes. The day of that rape, coincidentally, Hochul was \u201crallying\u201d in a room on the Barnard campus with Hillary Clinton and Vice President Kamala Harris, aiming to fire up young women with two of the Democratic Party\u2019s worst campaigners. \u201cI see . . . ads about crime every 30 seconds,\u201d Clinton railed of the supposed GOP campaign of fear. \u201cNo solutions, but just a lot of really fearful, scary pictures and scary music.\u201d Solutions? Zeldin has an extensive anti-crime strategy, from firing district attorneys who won\u2019t prosecute as the law commands to fixing the disastrous criminal-justice \u201creforms\u201d that Hochul pretends she\u2019s already fixed. Of course, the event was mostly about the nonexistent threat to abortion rights in New York, plus the \u201cendangered democracy\u201d warnings that even Democrats don\u2019t really believe . None of the powerful women addressed female New Yorkers\u2019 fears of sexual and physical violence \u2014 well-grounded fears, as the West Side rape proves. As of course does the case of Keaira Bennefield, the young Buffalo mom who police say was killed at the hands of her abusive husband after he was freed from jail without bail. Hochul\u2019s cold comment on that preventable horror: The system failed. Yes, the one she runs. Remarkably, the gov has also done multiple appearances on MSNBC, a network viewed exclusively by the Democratic base. But while Al Sharpton\u2019s show was certainly a safe place to slam her opponent, she had little to tell his viewers about anything she\u2019d done for them . Then again, Hochul has no answers for voters living in inner-city communities racked by crime and violence. Her campaign even got Bill Clinton from cryostasis to do a Brooklyn event. Yes, the guy who signed Democrats\u2019 1994 crime bill that every Dem from President Joe Biden on down now condemns. And even Bubba admits, \u201cThere is too much crime.\u201d And now Biden himself is due to show Sunday in Yonkers. His ratings aren\u2019t as underwater here as nationally, but even the Dem base wants him to retire in 2024: Will his whisper-shouts and fantasy \u201cmemories\u201d get them to the polls? Get set for a long aimless anecdote about tough Irish women . . . In another desperate gimmick, a new Dem-promoting ad pairs Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 who\u2019ve spent next to no time campaigning together \u2014 as \u201cwomen who are making history.\u201d Its telling tagline: \u201cTish James and Kathy Hochul are showing up for us. Now we have to show up for them.\u201d Is \u201cmaking history\u201d by simply holding office as a woman (a black one, in James\u2019 case) really an issue for New York women concerned not just about crime but also their shrinking buying power and their kids\u2019 learning loss? It\u2019s not just that Hochul is finding it tough to preaching to the choir, she\u2019s finding it tough to get the choir to show up. Democrats, like that group of Latino supermarket owners , Queens Councilman Robert Holden and other minorities , are defecting to Zeldin. Hochul\u2019s problem goes far beyond cold denialism on crime (blaming judges; blaming \u201cthe system): Her \u201cpositive\u201d message boils down to bragging about handing out hundreds of millions in subsidies to fund a billionaire\u2019s football stadium and a microchip plant while ordinary taxpayers struggle with rising food and gasoline prices. She is, as one wag put it, a hardboiled egg without salt \u2014 tasteless, bland and hard to swallow, even for the loyal Democratic base.

I\u2019m not allowed to celebrate this important day with my son because I am not boosted. As a healthy adult, I have made this personal decision that has no bearing on anyone other than myself.

It had to be said.", "content": "Warning: Manifest Season 4, Part 1 spoilers below. (Aside from Ben\u2019s bad beard.) Ahead of Manifest Season 4, I was certain nothing could distract me from the impending doom of the dreaded Death Date. But then I saw Ben Stone\u2019s beard, and suddenly all I could think about was his Shave Date. As fans of Jeff Rake\u2019s supernatural drama will recall, Season 3 ended with the tragic death of Ben\u2019s wife Grace and the kidnapping of their daughter Eden. When the end credits rolled, it wasn\u2019t clear if Grace was truly dead or if Eden would be reunited with her family anytime soon. But the two-year time jump in Season 4 quickly confirmed that Grace was indeed gone, and Eden was still missing. While the rest of the Stone family was coping with that harsh reality and focusing their energy on solving the Death Day dilemma, Ben was still falling apart. At the start of the season he was living in the attic, isolating himself from loved ones, spending every waking moment searching for Eden, and of course, neglecting his personal hygiene. As Chris Carrabba, lead singer of Dashboard Confessional famously sang in my 2006 Myspace song, \u201cStolen,\u201d \u201cWe all look like we feel.\u201d And Ben\u2019s unruly excuse for a beard in Season 4 effectively lets us know he feels like shit. Now, Ben has been through hell and recently endured two major tragedies, so his grief beard was fully justified. It\u2019s just that\u2026I really missed the clean-cut, in-control Benny Boy we came to know and love in Manifest \u2018s first three seasons. That guy was stylish, always sported the right amount of sexy stubble, and even let the occasional curl fall forward and kiss his forehead. Mmph! TV has blessed us with a fair share of good beards this year (yes, I\u2019m looking at Steve Carell in The Patient ), but Ben\u2019s sadly isn\u2019t one of them. That\u2019s not to say that Manifest actor Josh Dallas can\u2019t rock a beard IRL, but that this particular messy, moody mustache/beard combo is the antithesis of Ben\u2019s signature style. And its sheer presence on his face is encouraging him to cling to his darkest era. When Ben finally gets some solid leads on Eden\u2019s whereabouts, a little pep returns to his step. Unfortunately, the beard remains for far too many episodes. But at least Ben gives viewers hope that if he can just get his daughter back he can give himself permission to stop grieving so intensely. Without sharing too many spoilers, Ben finally says a big old BYE to his grief beard in Episode 6, but first he asks Olive if she thinks he should \u201ckeep the mountain man look.\u201d She laughs in his face and says, \u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d That\u2019s our girl. For the final few episodes, Ben restored some semblance of order to the Manifest universe by sporting his signature facial hair. And make no mistake, he looked fine as hell and ready to save the world. The first half of Manifest \u2018s fourth and final season features death, destruction, and heartbreak. But make no mistake, Ben\u2019s beard is up there as one of the most distressing plot points in Part 1. Thankfully, by the time the midseason finale arrived and a beard-less Ben said the words, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad man, I\u2019m just a daddy\u2026\u201d I could confidently take those words out of context, scream \u201cYEAH YOU ARE!\u201d at my TV screen, and mean it.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-6.8239827156066895, 6.166195869445801]}, {"title": "Ovechkin sets record for most goals with one team", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34957472/alex-ovechkin-sets-nhl-record-most-goals-one-team?device=featurephone", "description": "Alex Ovechkin set the NHL record for most goals scored with one franchise, netting his 787th career goal with the Washington Capitals to break a tie with Hockey Hall of Famer Gordie Howe's career total with the Detroit Red Wings.", "content": "Alex Ovechkin set the NHL record for most goals scored with one franchise, netting his 787th career goal with the Washington Capitals to break a tie with Hockey Hall of Famer Gordie Howe's career total with the Detroit Red Wings.

In the second period, Ovechkin posted his seventh goal of the season, a power-play tally with assists from Trevor van Riemsdyk and Anthony Mantha. Ovechkin tied Howe's mark Thursday night in Detroit when he netted his sixth goal of the season in a 3-1 loss to the Red Wings. Ovechkin has spent all 18 years of his NHL career with the Capitals, who drafted him first overall in 2004.

Ovechkin is closing in on Howe's NHL career total of 801 goals, which is second all-time behind Wayne Gretzky's 894-goal record. Mark Howe, Gordie's son and a Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman, believes Ovechkin will eventually pass both players. \"It's the way that Ovechkin has been scoring, and the pace that he does it. He's so big, so strong and so powerful,\" Mark Howe told ESPN last week. Ovechkin signed a five-year, $47 million extension in July 2021 that will keep him in Washington through 2026.

The in-ring action was strong, the storytelling and finishes were sound and Roman Reigns and Logan Paul delivered a drama-filled main event that will certainly leave fans wanting more of the rivalry. Here are five takeaways from Saturday\u2019s Crown Jewel from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It feels absurd that Logan Paul is operating on a main-event level just three matches into his WWE career, but that\u2019s where we are after the YouTube star completed an action-packed, drama-filled and downright entertaining main event with Roman Reigns. Paul came as close as anybody to ended The Undisputed WWE Universal champion\u2019s 797-day reign. There were more than a few occasions after a flying cross-body, a frog splash, one lucky punch and a perfect buckshot lariat that it felt like the referee\u2019s hand was going to hit the mat for three on Reigns. Paul\u2019s top-rope frog splash while filming on his cellphone in slow motion onto Reigns laid across the announce table will be watched by millions and millions. Paul\u2019s whole entourage, including his brother Jake, got into with the rest of The Bloodline to try to neutralize them. Jake even got to drop both Jimmy and Jey Uso. Still, the outside-the-ring shenanigans were enough to buy a reeling Reigns time to recover. As Logan Paul re-entered the ring, Reigns delivered a Superman punch and a spear to regain his belts. The Head of the Table looked like a man relieved to escape still champ. This all feels far from over, thought it may be awhile. Logan Paul announced afterward on his Instagram Stories that he tore his ACL, MCL and potentially his meniscus halfway through the match. THROUGH THE TABLE @WWE pic.twitter.com/hmVslclxgs Everyone will remember Bianca Belair\u2019s phenomenal WrestleMania match with Sasha Banks \u2014 whose name was actually mentioned on the broadcast \u2014 but Bayley remains the premier rivalry of the EST\u2019s young career. The two have wrestled seven televised singles matches, with no fans, with a ladder, inside Hell in a Cell and now a super fun Last Women\u2019s Standing Match that should provide a fitting pin in the rivalry for now. Bayley\u2019s chemistry and charisma have helped solidify Belair as a star. This felt no different. Bayley provided numerous obstacles for Belair to overcome. She used weapons, trapped her between the ring steps, trapped her in a stage box, hit the Bayley to Belly on the stage and then tried to run her over with a golf cart while still up there. Thankfully things ended better for Belair than Sammy Guevara as she escaped and then drove the cart. with Bayley on top back, down to the ring. WWE showed enough respect to Bayley that they had Belair have to ingeniously trap her inside a ladder and pinned her against the ring post to finally get the 10 count. Bray Wyatt and WWE is dragging out his story drip by drip. Wyatt, appearing live in the ring, for the first time mentioned his prestigious and larger than life wrestling family, but didn\u2019t actually say Rotunda. A Twitter user earlier in the day pointed out that a woman in one of Wyatt video\u2019s looked like his real life sister Mika and one theory is that the mysterious Uncle Howdy is his brother Bo Dallas. While this story could still be Wyatt battling his own internal demons \u2013 was one we saw on SmackDown. Him dropping the family reference is a least another strand that could lead us to Dallas\u2019s returns. Wyatt\u2019s symbol also appeared on a TV next to former partner Alexa Bliss during a backstage interview, so that nugget is also still being teased. What could be behind this message for Bray Wyatt? #WWECrownJewel pic.twitter.com/t48RxsU5DN Bobby Lashley and Brock Lesnar had a trilogy written all over it coming into the event and even more so after the Beast\u2019s narrow victory. The former UFC heavyweight champion was at his selling best as Lashley dominated him in a way few men have. Lesnar sold an injured leg pretty much from the start and his facials were superb while being stuck in the Hurt Lock. He even yelled, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to give up! Shut up!\u201d to the referee. The match was filled with explosive moves as expected, but an old finish was brilliantly used to add to enhance the story. Lesnar, while in the Hurt Lock, was able to push himself off the turnbuckles and on top of Lashley \u2013 pinning his opponent\u2019s shoulders to the ground for the win. Lashley and Lesnar are now tied at a win apiece and the All Mighty \u2013 who attacked The Beast after the match \u2013 has every right to ask for a rematch at either Survivor Series or Royal Rumble. If only the Fight Pit wasn\u2019t just used. Yes, Jimmy and Jey Uso successfully defended the Undisputed tag team championship against Butch and Ridge Holland, but prior to the match Cole revealed something that could weigh heavy on their future as champs. He said Jey Uso, whose wrist was heavily wrapped, may have suffered a broken wrist during WWE\u2019s international tour in the lead-up to Crown Jewel and was going to get an MRI exam on Monday to confirm. It all could be a kayfabe injury or nothing serious at all. It is however worth monitoring with The Usos are set to defend their titles against the New Day \u2013 whose record reign they are quickly approaching \u2013 Friday on \u201cSmackDown.\u201d If it\u2019s legit Jey needs to be out for an extended prior of time, do plans around the titles change? Does Sami or Solo step in? The 1D from the top rope to Butch was a cool finish to the match at Crown Jewel. Damage CTRL (Iyo Sky and Dakota Kai) vs. Alexa Bliss and Asuka to win the WWE women\u2019s tag team championships. Asuka and Bliss\u2019 title reign was short-lived \u2013 just four days. This was a very solid match and the chemistry between Asuka and Sky makes me want to see that dream singles match even more. Nikki Cross is going to continue to test Bliss and Asuka\u2019s sanity as she interfered out of nowhere to cost them the belts. Damage CTRL needs a few more bodies to complete at WarGames team. You can pretty much pencil Cross in after this. OMG!! It\u2019s Nikki Cross !!! #WWECrownJewel #WWE pic.twitter.com/sFXnwBiDOb Drew McIntyre over Karrion Kross (Steel Cage Match) This was the one somewhat puzzling outcome as the two men have now competed in a strap match and a steel cage match. Curious to see what WWE does to settle this feud with each now owning win. The storytelling did make sense. Scarlett interfered three times to try to save cross \u2013 the first with a simple distraction, then with the pepper spray and the last time by locking the cage door. The last came back to bite the duo as McIntyre was able to climb out of the cage before Kross \u2013 delayed by the locked door \u2013 could make it out. The Judgement Day (Finn Balor, Dominik Mysterio, Damian Priest) over The O.C. (A.J. Styles, Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) Hey, we got an actual \u201cBullet Club\u201d mention was Michael Cole! All of this so far as been WWE adding layers to this story in a likely lead-up to a Survivor Series match. The Club will need the return of Edge and Beth Phoenix to finally get the best of The Judgment Day \u2013 who WWE continues to book strongly. This came down to Ripley bashing Styles into the ring apron and rolling him back to the ring for Balor to deliver the Coup de Grace for the win. Kudos to Cole for saying, \u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta kick her ass!\u201d of Ripley. It sets up Phoenix\u2019s return. Braun Strowman over Omos The two giants told a story similar to what we saw in Lashley vs. Lesnar. \u201cThe Monster of All Monsters\u201d was completely manhandled by Omos for the majority of the match, even derailing the Strowman Express move. Strowman did get a win that was much-more definitive than Lesnar\u2019s \u2013 impressively lifting up Omos and delivering the running power slam for the win. It all could mean good things for Strowman going forward.

Hendon Hooker entered the game as a favorite in the Heisman race, but his chances of winning that trophy likely took a hit after he passed for less than 200 yards with no touchdown passes and one interception.

The brothers, who were born three years apart, toured together for many years in the \u201990s and early aughts, with Aaron often singing as the Backstreet Boys\u2019 opening act.

Varlamov was replaced by Ilya Sorokin with 8:13 left. \u201cGive them credit, they played well,\u201d Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. \u201cI thought they were taking away time and space but I didn\u2019t think we played fast enough and there\u2019s no excuse for it.\u201d The Red Wings had two power plays and a 13-7 advantage in shots on goal in the first period but it ended scoreless. Detroit was awarded a 5-on-3 advantage in the second, and this time it capitalized. Kubalik set up Raymond, who was parked near the goalpost. He lifted a shot over Varlamov\u2019s right pad for his fourth goal. The Islanders had allowed just three power-play goals coming into the day. Raymond also scored a power-play goal off a Kubalik feed against Washington on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better for sure. We have a lot of looks every power play,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cKubby has found me really good there (at the side of the net), so I just try to be in the right spot.\u201d Adam Erne cleared the puck out of his zone, setting up Suter\u2019s breakaway goal at 12:51 of the second. It was the first short-handed goal allowed by the Islanders this season. \u201cWe\u2019d had a couple of power plays, so we knew we were going to have to spend some time on the PK,\u201d Suter said. \u201cGetting a two-goal lead is huge and doing it short-handed just takes away all of their momentum.\u201d The Red Wings killed off two penalties in the first seven minutes of the third. Husso made a sliding stop against Mathew Barzal with 12 minutes left. Kubalik scored his fifth goal with a wrist shot from the left circle with 9:47 remaining. With four games coming up next week, Lambert said his team won\u2019t dwell on the loss. \u201cYou look at it just like we do a win and we see things we liked about it, because there was some things to like about it, and then we\u2019ll see the things we have to correct and move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week coming up.

A parent said he reported Dr. Mark Nesselson to the state Office for Professional Medical Conduct after seeing a falsified vaccination for his child allegedly prepared by the doctor. The father said his daughter had not been seen by the pediatrician on the day recorded for one of the vaccines in 2021, which was on an official form provided by Nesselson. The doctor also gave the family a form for insurance reimbursement that indicated an office visit had taken place that day for the shot when it had not, the dad said. The purported phony record included the MMR, polio vaccine and other standard shots for toddlers. It was allegedly created by Nesselson for the child\u2019s mother, presumably to be used for school admissions, according to a copy of the parent\u2019s complaint to the state. Proof of vaccination is mandated for day care or attending school in New York. The father said his family doled out about $4,300 to Nesselson over two and a half years , although some of that did cover legitimate office visits with the pediatrician. The OPMC acknowledged the parent\u2019s complaint in March 2022, according to a copy of a letter seen by The Post.

Their 27-13 beatdown of No. 1 Tennessee before a deafening crowd at Sanford Stadium was about as thorough as it gets. Senior quarterback Stetson Bennett passed for 257 yards and two touchdowns, and the Georgia defense held Tennessee's high-scoring offense without a touchdown until the final minutes of the game. The Bulldogs, who were ranked No. 3 in the initial CFP rankings, dominated the line of scrimmage, as Bennett repeatedly had plenty of time to throw and hit deep shots down the field of 52, 49 and 37 yards. Meanwhile, the Vols had no answers on offense for Georgia's swarming defense. Tennessee came into the game leading the country in scoring (49.4 points per game) but was forced to punt three times in the first quarter. That's after punting a total of 18 times in the previous eight games. It was that kind of afternoon for the Vols, who lost their sixth straight game to the Bulldogs and were bullied physically after scoring a combined 92 points in wins over ranked opponents Alabama and LSU earlier this season. Georgia (9-0) took a commanding lead in the SEC Eastern Division race and also put itself in prime position to make the College Football Playoff even if it were to lose in the SEC championship game, which would be similar to what happened last season. Tennessee (8-1) was never able to get on track offensively against a Georgia defense that has allowed just eight touchdowns in nine games. The Bulldogs' national championship defense a year ago, a defense that produced five NFL first-round selections, gave up 16 touchdowns in 15 games. In the third quarter, the rain started pouring down, and the Bulldogs just continued to pour it on a Tennessee team that was greeted with chants of \"overrated\" by the Georgia student section. The Vols were playing in the loudest and most hostile environment they have faced all season. They seemed rattled by the crowd noise, which reached rock concert decibels at times. They committed one false start penalty after another, and in the first half when the game was still close, the Vols were flagged for back-to-back false starts after moving inside the 10-yard line and had to settle for a field goal. Tennessee's deep passing game was rendered nonexistent against a Georgia defense that was playing without its best pass-rusher, senior outside linebacker Nolan Smith, who is out for the season after tearing a pectoral muscle. The Bulldogs showed off their depth and never allowed Hendon Hooker to find any rhythm. Hooker, the Heisman Trophy favorite entering the game, finished 23 for 33 for 195 and didn't throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 20 games. Hooker was sacked six times and also threw an interception in the second quarter. He was under duress for much of the game, as the Bulldogs repeatedly got pressure. He was hit hard in the final minutes and got up slowly before gingerly trotting off the field. The Vols' longest pass play of the game was 17 yards. They came into the game with an FBS-leading 36 plays from scrimmage of 30 yards or longer.

Two days later, tens of thousands of rugby fans descended on the city\u2019s largest stadium for the Hong Kong Sevens, its biggest (and usually booziest) annual sporting event, which had been suspended since 2019 due to political unrest, and, later, Covid-19. The two high-profile international events sent a clear message: After almost three years of border closures, mandatory quarantines, and restrictions on businesses and social gatherings, Hong Kong was finally reopening. For much of the pandemic, the semi-autonomous Chinese city maintained some of the region\u2019s most stringent restrictions, including one of the world\u2019s longest mandatory quarantines for international arrivals. With the economy tanking and concerns mounting that Hong Kong was being left behind as the world moved on, the government finally threw open the city\u2019s doors in September and ended formal quarantine to the relief of millions of people. \u201cWe were, we are and we will remain one of the world\u2019s leading financial centers,\u201d vowed Hong Kong leader John Lee at Wednesday\u2019s summit, attended by more than 200 investors from 20 countries. \u201cYou can take that to the bank.\u201d Speaking on Friday ahead of the kickoff of the Sevens, Hong Kong Rugby Union CEO Robbie McRobbie hailed the return of the tournament as a \u201ccatalyst, watershed,\u201d a symbol that \u201cHong Kong is still a vibrant, resilient city.\u201d But experts warn the push to revive Hong Kong, while welcome and long overdue, faces many challenges ahead. The past few years of isolation, which coincided with an ongoing political crackdown, have taken their toll, they said. Despite what Lee and other leaders insist, the Hong Kong that\u2019s reopening is not the same city the world knew before the pandemic \u2013 and the true impact of that change remains to be seen. Last year, as many destinations reopened to travelers and relaxed restrictions, Hong Kong appeared to be stuck in a different reality. Restaurants, bars and gyms were frequently forced to shutter or limit their hours. Residential buildings were placed under lockdown for days. At one point, public gatherings were capped at two people. And most residents didn\u2019t leave the city for years, unable or unwilling to spend up to three weeks in hotel quarantine at their own cost upon return. Businesses were hit hard. The Sevens tournament makes up 95% of the Hong Kong Rugby Union\u2019s revenue, so \u201cwe\u2019ve had three years of redundancies and cutbacks,\u201d said McRobbie. Many disillusioned residents chose to leave permanently; this past year, the city recorded its steepest drop in population since records began in 1961. Companies, too, began eyeing other locations \u2013 most notably Singapore, Hong Kong\u2019s longtime regional rival. Hong Kong's U-turn on quarantine is a sign Beijing still needs its gate to the West But Hong Kong authorities, eager to reopen the border with mainland China \u2013 which still shows no sign of easing its strict zero-Covid policy that aims to stamp out infections \u2013 remained reluctant to loosen restrictions for fear cases would spike and close that door. Then, a severe outbreak fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant at the start of the year put an end to Hong Kong\u2019s hope of maintaining zero daily cases. Under mounting public pressure, the government lifted flight bans with certain countries and shortened hotel quarantine in March \u2013 but these small concessions did little to lure people back. According to media reports in August, some Wall Street banks warned their executives would only attend Wednesday\u2019s finance summit if there was quarantine-free travel \u2013 a widely-speculated factor behind the government\u2019s ultimate decision to scrap quarantine. Finance leaders in the city breathed a sigh of relief at the news. \u201cWe\u2019ve been closed for too long,\u201d said Sebastian Paredes, CEO of Singaporean bank DBS\u2019 Hong Kong operations. \u201cWe are beginning to open up following the other parts of the world that have already opened up. And this is a tangible demonstration that Hong Kong is back.\u201d Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific Economist of French investment bank Natixis, agreed the week\u2019s dual big events were \u201ca big sign of Hong Kong moving away from Covid restrictions to a new world.\u201d However, the remaining restrictions pose a competitive disadvantage. International visitors must take Covid tests for seven straight days after arrival in Hong Kong, and for the first three days are barred from restaurants, bars and gyms. But the testing doesn\u2019t stop there \u2013 bars and clubs that don\u2019t serve food require proof of a negative rapid antigen test from all patrons. A mask mandate \u2013 indoors and outdoors \u2013 is also in effect, though photos of the finance summit show attendees sitting at tables without face coverings. They included the city\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who was declared a \u201crecovered case\u201d by health authorities after testing positive for Covid upon arrival from a trip abroad on Tuesday. These rules are \u201cstill largely prohibiting the overseas travel market,\u201d said McRobbie, the Hong Kong rugby chief. Before the pandemic, roughly half the fans at the Sevens came from abroad; this year, that number is \u201cnegligible,\u201d he said. The long stretch of isolation and financial hardship has also created challenges for companies hoping for a comeback. Many people have left the sports and events sectors in the past few years in favor of more stable jobs, leaving the industry short staffed, McRobbie added. This partial reopening has left the city in an awkward Covid limbo, said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cIf we want to open up our border with the Mainland China, our restriction is too lenient \u2026 so it\u2019s not allowed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then if we want to open ourselves up to the world, we are still too stringent. We are now stuck in between, hoping to see better policies in the future.\u201d Others also warn of growing political challenges. \u201cClouds are certainly coming to Hong Kong from different angles,\u201d said banker Garcia-Herrero, pointing to the West\u2019s response to the sweeping national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020. Under this law, pro-democracy activists have been jailed or exiled, independent newsrooms shut down, and former lawmakers targeted. Meanwhile, authorities have changed school curricula to emphasize Chinese history and culture, and pushed greater economic cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, a national scheme to link China\u2019s southern Guangdong province closer with Hong Kong and Macao. The law has been widely criticized by foreign governments and human rights organizations, with the United States sanctioning Lee and other top Hong Kong officials over their role in the crackdown. Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly claimed the law has restored order and stability after the city\u2019s 2019 anti-government, pro-democracy protests. For the US and the European Union, the national security law and crackdown represent \u201ca change in the rules of the game in what was agreed upon,\u201d said Garcia-Herrero. Xi Jinping brought Hong Kong to heel. Now he's back in a city transformed These rising tensions could spell trouble for Hong Kong\u2019s trade and diplomatic relationships with other countries. Hong Kong is afforded more freedoms than other Chinese cities, thus has long been seen as a gateway between the mainland and the West \u2013 a position that looks increasingly precarious as its civil liberties erode. \u201cThe West would now understand that Hong Kong is not only part of China, but it\u2019s closer to China than before,\u201d said Yuen, the economics lecturer. \u201cThe worst scenario is that the West would treat Hong Kong as the same as the mainland China, and then Hong Kong would suffer the kind of sanctions.\u201d And this drawing closer together is likely to continue. In an effort to stem the brain drain, the government is spending 30 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.8 billion) to draw in global businesses and fresh talent \u2013 which Yuen said is expected to \u201cattract a lot of mainland workers\u201d who may be eager to escape an even more dire job market across the border. Despite these geopolitical frictions, some argue Hong Kong\u2019s innate advantages will allow a revival \u2013 even if the city is heading in a different direction than before. Asia doesn\u2019t have many other financial centers that can match Hong Kong\u2019s open regulatory environment, low salaries tax and existing financial infrastructure \u2013 \u201ctherefore, even if the image may be tarnished a little bit, there are not many other places to go,\u201d said Garcia-Herrero. Yuen echoed this point, saying the city\u2019s proximity to China remains appealing to businesses and investors hoping to tap into the vast and lucrative mainland market. \u201cWe can plug into China and sort of maintain the status as having a little bit of autonomy, and (being) different from them, given different Covid policies and (systems of) governance,\u201d she said. But, both experts acknowledged, the path forward is now fraught with new risks. International businesses may come to Hong Kong, but be warier in how much they invest in the city, keeping in mind the threat of US sanctions and regional conflict. Today\u2019s Hong Kong is increasingly under Beijing\u2019s control, with China growing more assertive on the world stage as leader Xi Jinping enters a third term in power surrounded by loyalists. Those rising tensions between China and its rivals have caused growing divides \u201cas the world deglobalizes,\u201d said Garcia-Herrero \u2013 effects that inevitably spill over into Hong Kong, caught in the middle. \u201cIt will never be, in my opinion, what it used to be in terms of the openness of Hong Kong to both the West and the East,\u201d she said.

Fans of Westworld won't get to see the show again \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future. HBO decided Friday to cancel the hit sci-fi series after its recent fourth season, which ended on Aug. 14. Westworld was one of the most talked-about TV series since its debut on HBO in 2016. As recently as mid-October, show runners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy were still talking about the possibility of an extension. \"We had always conceived of a fifth and final season,\" Nolan tod Variet y . \"We're still in conversations with the network.\" The dystopian drama set in a high-tech, Wild West-centric theme park also racked up many awards, including 54 Emmy Award nominations. In 2018, Thandiwe Newton won a primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

Top Republicans in the House of Representatives say the road to their majority will run through the Empire State , after redistricting left the historically blue stronghold with toss-up seats they aim to turn red. \u201cWe believe New York is a top battleground state. We have a chance to win a bunch of seats in New York and we have invested nearly $10 million in making that happen,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Republicans need to flip just five seats to take control of the House and snatch the speaker\u2019s gavel from California Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The chairman has been barnstorming the country on behalf of his candidates: \u201cI\u2019m like a rock coming back to the Earth, bouncing through the atmosphere, every day we are in a different place.\u201d He is hopeful about the Empire State. \u201cYou have a special situation in New York,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cDemocrats control every level of government in New York and frankly the voters are fed up with the results we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s the other reason I\u2019m very confident we\u2019re going to have a good night in New York.\u201d The red wave isn\u2019t likely to reach into New York City\u2019s five boroughs, but the party is targeting a slew of districts in Long Island and upstate New York. The top target is Emmer\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a scandal-scarred Hudson Valley Congressman who currently heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cMike Lawler, I believe is going to beat Sean Patrick Maloney,\u201d Emmer said. \u201c[Maloney] has pushed radical pro-criminal polices like cashless bail that allows violent criminals to literally terrorize innocent citizens at 9 o\u2019clock at night and be back on the street committing more crimes by 9 am the next morning.\u201d \u201cLong Island could be a sweep,\u201d Emmer added, boasting that not only did he expect to hold GOP Reps. Lee Zeldin\u2019s and Andrew Garbarino\u2019s seats, but that he believed the party would flip the other two seats in Democratic hands, now open thanks to the retirements of Reps. Tom Suozzi and Kathleen Rice. Emmer repeatedly dismissed Democratic fundraising, which has bested GOP money hauls in virtually every hot race in New York this cycle. Maloney himself has raised almost five times the cash as Lawler. \u201cThe issues they\u2019re running on are not the issues that people care about. They have been burning money in the streets.\u201d Emmer sniffed. \u201cWe never have their money. I would argue it costs more to sell a lie than to sell the truth.\u201d The GOP is also playing defense in New York in a few races, putting in cash to save Rep. Nicole Malliotakis on Staten Island and to hold onto an open GOP seat upstate which includes Democratic strongholds like Utica and Binghamton. Though Emmer was confident the majority was in the bag, he refused to speculate on how many seats the party might pick up in New York, which he visited last month. \u201cThe energy is there,\u201d Emmer said.

Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro is taking his second stab at the seat after losing a special election to Rep. Pat Ryan in August in a race that was widely considered a bellwether. With redistricting, Ryan hopped to the neighboring 18th district, while Molinaro will face Riley, a local attorney from Endicott. The new 19th district leans Democrat, and supported Joe Biden over President Trump by a 52-48 percent margin. But amid spiraling crime and inflation since Molinaro\u2019s first loss, Emmer said Molinaro was \u201cgoing to win.\u201d NY \u2014 18 Poughkeepsie, Beekman, Kiryas Joel Rep.

He will go head-to-head against New Windsor Assemblyman Colin Schmitt. Both men have deep ties to the district and the race is one of the the state\u2019s most competitive. Schmitt has leaned into GOP talking points around \u201creckless spending\u201d and Historic inflation. Ryan has made abortion rights a central issue. NY \u2014 17 Hudson Valley, New City, Yorktown Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (Democrat) \u2014 Incumbent Total Raised: $5 million Mike Lawler (Republican) \u2014 Challenger Total Raised: $1.1 million Latest Poll: Lawler up by 6 points Maloney is the only member of the House Democratic leadership facing a competitive race this cycle and knocking him out has become a top GOP priority. The party has dumped millions into the race to boost Assemblyman Mike Lawler. Maloney, a talented fundraiser and dogged campaigner, alienated many allies when he muscled his way into the 17th district after redistricting. The region\u2019s incumbent Democrat, freshman \u201cSquad\u201d member Mondaire Jones , ultimately jumped ship for a tough Manhattan primary that he lost to Levi Strauss & Co. heir Dan Goldman. Maloney subsequently beat back a challenge from woke State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi. During his time in office, Maloney made a name for himself hiring violent ex-cons into top party positions, giving his personal trainer a job on his House staff, and supporting cashless bail . \u201cI think he\u2019s gone.

Both are openly gay, marking a first for a major-party congressional race in the US. Suozzi handily put away Santos in 2020, but with his retirement, Republicans are increasingly hoping that a red wave could bring the aspiring pol over the finish line. Zimmerman has sniped at Santos over his apparent opposition to abortion rights and Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure bill, while Santos says his opponent had an agenda that \u201cdoes not speak to the issues we have today.\u201d Sheinkopf said. \u201cZimmerman was all abortion until a week ago, suddenly he became crime.

Kathleen Rice, offering another open seat for Republicans to snatch. The race pits Gillen, a former Hempstead town supervisor, against D\u2019Esposito, a retired NYPD detective. The district has been controlled by Democrats for two decades, but Long Island Republicans are hoping for large turnout from the faithful and that enthusiasm for native son Zeldin could drive expanded turnout. D\u2019Esposito has been named in at least three lawsuits during his time with the NYPD which cost the city more than $80,000 in settlement payouts. NY \u2014 25 Rochester Rep.

However, its precursor nonprofits New York Harm Reduction Educators and Washington Heights CORNER Project, pocketed nearly $3.4 million in state funds the past three years \u2013 including more than $1.4 million this year alone while Hochul was in office, records show. Both nonprofits have also received nearly $2 million in discretionary funds during the past three years from the City Council, including $25,000 for this fiscal year from Democratic socialist Kristin Richardson Jordan of Manhattan, records show. Sam Rivera, OnPoint\u2019s executive director, said any public funds the nonprofit gets are used to support other programs it runs beyond the \u201csafe [drug] consumption program,\u201d including food assistance and mental health services. Councilwoman Diana Ayala (D-Manhattan/Bronx), whose district includes East Harlem and who recently introduced a City Council bill to pay drug users for used needles , said she shares her constituents\u2019 \u201cfrustration\u201d about the pervasion of public drug use, but believes OnPoint is helping address the problem. \u201cIt breaks my heart when people complain about open drug use,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be arresting our way out of the opioid crisis, and when we offer alternatives, people push back.\u201d Residents describe daily life over the past year as a needle-filled nightmare. The Sanitation Department said it\u2019s collected at least 5,660 needles in the neighborhood since the East Harlem injection center opened on Nov. 29, 2021 \u2014 nearly double the 2,865 collected over the previous year. \u201cI\u2019m a lefty liberal from way back when \u2026 and I\u2019m so fed up,\u201d said local artist Jenny Scobel, 67, who has recorded several videos along Park Avenue near 116th Street of men passed out while others inject themselves in broad daylight. \u201cI don\u2019t hate Hochul, but I think she\u2019s made some big mistakes \u2026 She\u2019s gotta wake up.\u201d Hazel Crampton-Hays, a Hochul spokeswoman, defended the governor\u2019s record, saying the East Harlem site \u201cis not a state-regulated facility, and we continue to work closely with the city, law enforcement, and public health officials to combat the opioid crisis that has killed thousands of our fellow New Yorkers. \u201cWhile the state has decriminalized the possession of needles and syringes and the possession of opioid antagonists to save lives, heroin remains illegal, and nothing in the law prevents police officers from enforcing other criminal conduct and violations of the law that may take place, and we continue to work with prosecutors to enforce the law and crack down on traffickers and those who peddle deadly illegal substances,\u201d she added.

It is often the right thing. It just is far less interesting and, thus, worse for the game.", "content": "HOUSTON \u2014 Astros manager Dusty Baker pulled Cristian Javier after 97 pitches and six innings in Game 4 of the World Series though the right-hander was throwing a no-hitter. It was the right thing, for both Javier and the Astros, who completed a combined no-hitter. Baker stuck with Justin Verlander through trouble in the fifth inning of Game 5 and somewhere in both his heart and brain, the manager admitted later, was the understanding that the veteran righty needed one more out to qualify for his long-attempted first World Series win . It was the right thing for Verlander, who got the win, and it also turned out well for the Astros. Those two victories, which gave Houston a 3-2 series lead and moved it to the brink of winning the 118th World Series, exemplify an overarching problem for central baseball. So much that is efficient and smart these days can rob pitchers of the chance for individual accomplishments \u2014 the kind that might draw more than a local fan base to care. Let\u2019s take them one at a time: 1. I have witnessed three Javier starts in person this year. Two ended in combined no-hitters \u2014 one in June versus the Yankees and the other in Game 4 of the World Series. Javier is the most dominant pitcher I have seen in 2022. Yet, both no-hitters played into the modern game: They were meaningful to a local market, but didn\u2019t resonate nationally. There is a difference between a team allowing no hits and a no-hitter. The no-hitter, to me, is when one pitcher is fighting fatigue and facing a lineup for the third time, while coping with the tension associated with being out there alone the whole time. That quest could draw outside interest. But a relay-race no-hitter? Maybe if it were a close game in which one swing could change the outcome. But in Game 4, Houston raced to an early 5-0 lead. Maybe if a home crowd were creating an atmosphere, but Game 4 was in Philadelphia. And maybe if we just were not inundated with this. For what is rare is valuable. And in 2022, no-hitters were carried through four innings 225 times (roughly nine times a week), through five innings 108 times (four times a week) and through six innings 47 times (twice a week). There has been just one solo no-hitter, by the Angels\u2019 Reid Detmers, and three combined, the two by the Astros and one by the Mets versus the Phillies on April 29. Even for Mets fans that feels like the uninteresting stepchild of Johan Santana\u2019s solo effort in 2012. Yes, of course, that was the first in franchise history. But imagine if the first had been a tag team no-hitter. Meh. Terry Collins let Santana throw 134 pitches to chase history. Santana was never the same after that in what turned out to be the final 10 starts of his career. Javier had never thrown more than the 115 pitches he tossed against the Yankees in the June no-hitter. He had never been asked to get an out in the eighth inning. Allowing him to finish the Game 4 no-hitter would have been like asking someone who runs the 1,500 meters to jump right to a marathon. Baker was right to remove Javier to protect him, win the game and perhaps have him available in some form if there were a Game 7. But the logic made the no-hitter all less compelling outside Houston. 2. Conversely, Baker left Verlander in to complete five innings in Game 5. The lone blemish on Verlander\u2019s Cooperstown-bound career was that he was 0-6 in eight World Series starts with a 6.07 ERA. He had personally given up the lead in six of the eight starts. If he already had a Fall Classic win, then I strongly believe Baker would have gone to the bullpen with two out and a runner on second in the fifth. Because the hitter due up, Nick Castellanos, had smoked the ball in his previous at-bat against Verlander. And because the Astros\u2019 bullpen has been the biggest force of this postseason (0.88 ERA). Just to revisit why the no-hitter was so anticlimactic, there were 152 times this year in which three different relievers threw at least three innings of no-hit relief, including Game 4. Once relievers come in, we are now conditioned that hitters are about to be overwhelmed. But in Game 5, Baker trusted his ace, who won a 10-pitch battle to get Castellanos to fly out with his 94th pitch. The drama then was enhanced as we waited to learn whether the Astros could get to the finish line to earn Verlander the win. It was an enticing side story \u2014 The Old Man and the \u201cW.\u201d Again, smartly, the modern game has drained the importance of the pitching win or accumulating 20 victories in a season, just as it has with stats such as 100 RBIs or batting .300. But those were achievements that kept fans interested \u2014 the individual quests. And those who still care about them have been made to feel antiquated, stupid or both. But those stats haven\u2019t been replaced by something else. No one is sitting during a game hoping their favorite player reaches 5.0 Wins Above Replacement for the season. The individual odyssey within a game and within a season has been minimized. It is often the right thing.

Surely the ultimate risk/reward verdict was rendered by whichever \u201cMr. Jacobs\u201d \u2014 Jeremy or Charlie \u2014 is currently in charge of these ownership things. But I am not sure such odious judgement reflects a particular rot in hockey culture any more than the Yankees trotting out Domingo German and Aroldis Chapman \u2014 a pair of pitchers who served suspensions for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policies \u2014 reflects a particular rot in baseball culture. No one wants to root for a reprobate. But it all becomes a little less distasteful if a miscreant wearing the proper-color laundry can contribute to a championship, doesn\u2019t it? That is the calculus of pro sports. Further, that is also the calculus of big business, the entertainment industry and our political system \u2014 where generating windfall profits and amassing power are the equivalent of winning titles, are they not? One would almost think we as a society have accepted the trade-off or else we might have constructed a different type of reward system. And though pro leagues and pro sports teams do have an obligation to establish some sort of standard of employment and behavior, it is absurd to ask or expect these entities to be a substitute for the criminal justice system. It also seems absurd to expect those organizations to act with honor. That\u2019s not really why they exist. Mitchell Miller conducted a series of vile acts as an adolescent in a racially motivated campaign against a classmate named Isaiah Meyer-Crothers, who had developmental disabilities. Miller, at age 14, pleaded guilty to one count of assault and one count of violating the Ohio Safe Schools Act. He has never appeared particularly remorseful. The Coyotes drafted Miller in the fourth round of the 2020 draft, but soon after renounced his rights in the wake of reporting by the Arizona Republic that exposed the pattern of bullying, abuse and misconduct the then-teenager conducted against Meyer-Crothers. According to Meyer-Crothers\u2019 mother, Tina, the abuse began in the second grade while her son was growing up in a suburb of Toledo. The day after the Coyotes renounced Miller\u2019s rights, he was dropped by the University of North Dakota hockey program. He sat out the 2020-21 season, but last year rejoined the USHL Tri Cities Storm in Kearney, Neb., for which he established league records for goals and points in a season by a defenseman (39-44-83) and was designated USHL player of the year. That apparently went a long way toward influencing the Bruins\u2019 thinking that an anticipated short-term PR hit would be worth weathering. It is noteworthy that no one from the Bruins\u2019 hierarchy contacted anyone from the Meyer-Crothers family, including the victim, over what Sweeney claimed was a vetting process of almost a year. You know what? When you don\u2019t seriously want answers, it is more convenient not to ask questions. Sweeney, who was tasked with being the face of the organization after the signing was announced, attempted to convince folks that Miller \u2014 who has been assigned to AHL Providence \u2014 had committed a one-time mistake even though the evidence is contrary to that assertion. The signing is an embarrassment, all right, for the NHL and for the Bruins. You would hope that your team wouldn\u2019t stoop so low, but chances are they probably would. Pro sports are not about morality. Commissioner Gary Bettman, speaking to reporters in Finland on Saturday, said Miller is \u201cnot eligible at this point,\u201d calling his behavior \u201creprehensible, unacceptable.\u201d \"I was on the fence.\" @FriedgeHNIC sat down with Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron and asked him about the team's signing of renounced Coyotes draft pick, Mitchell Miller. pic.twitter.com/3fUHWDJWkc Nevertheless, the signing is an embarrassment, for the NHL and for the Bruins. You would hope that your team wouldn\u2019t stoop so low, but chances are they probably would. Pro sports are not about morality. Pro sports are not alone. The digital ads appearing on the boards do exactly what they are meant to do, which is to at least momentarily distract you and direct your attention from the game to a sponsor. They are annoying. But not as offensive as the incessant promotion of gambling from the moment a pregame show starts to the moment a postgame show ends. And not as self-defeating for the league as its paying customer-unfriendly blackout rules. It is 2022, not 1962. The 2018-19 Sabres were 17-6-2 as of Nov. 27 before plummeting thereafter, so we will reserve judgement on this 2022-23 Buffalo squad that entered the weekend at 7-4-0. But the Sabres are an entertaining group that appears filled with kids and tweeners who have embraced playing for the franchise rather than guys marking time to get out and another group driven out by dysfunctional management and ownership. And though it is always a surprise to see another player with Alexander Mogilny\u2019s No. 89 (and in those classic, vintage uniforms, no less), Alex Tuch sure does wear it well. Then, too, it sure seems as if Jack Eichel\u2019s surgery was safe, yah? The Flyers of John Tortorella remind me of the circa 2009-11 Rangers of John Tortorella, a team of not enough high-end talent or depth with which to contend, but a generally structured club difficult to play. And yes, that is Carter Hart \u2014 proving he is no Blaine Lacher \u2014 playing the role of Henrik Lundqvist. The Red Wings are celebrating their 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup championship teams this weekend, yet a quarter-century later still haven\u2019t retired Sergei Fedorov\u2019s No. 91. Just saying.

Carter\u2019s rep did not immediately return a Post request for comment. Carter was born on Dec. 7, 1987 in Florida.

He released his self-titled debut album, which sold a million copies, that same year, when shortly before he turned 10 years old. He went on to open for other major acts including Britney Spears. He quickly shot to stardom in the late \u201990s, selling millions of records with pop hits like \u201cI\u2019m All About You,\u201d \u201cI Want Candy,\u201d and \u201cAaron\u2019s Party (Come Get It).\u201d The pre-teen heartthrob went on to become a regular on Nickelodeon and guest-starred on Disney Channel.

According to ESPN Analytics, the winner of this game will also have a 99% chance of winning the SEC East. This has been a lopsided series in recent years as Georgia enters the showdown riding a five-game winning streak -- tied for its longest in series history -- with all five wins by more than 20 points. Tennessee will look to change that with Heisman Trophy-favorite Hendon Hooker at the helm. Hooker has 21 touchdown passes this season, second to only Peyton Manning (23) through eight games in program history. Most of them have gone to Jalin Hyatt (14), who's on pace to become the third receiver in SEC history to catch 20 touchdown passes in a season. Here are the best moments from Tennessee-Georgia: Dawgs strike fast It took one play for the Bulldogs to extend their lead as Stetson Bennett found Ladd McConkey for a 37-yard touchdown. Georgia leads 14-3. Bennett finds the end zone UGA quarterback Stetson Bennett found receiver Arian Smith on a 52-yard pass to get Georgia into Tennessee territory. On third down at the Vols' 13-yard line, Bennett showed his mobility on a scramble and pylon dive for the score. Georgia leads 7-3 after the extra point. Vols capitalize on Bulldogs' turnover Bulldogs running back Daijun Edwards fumbled on the opening drive which led to a field goal for the Volunteers. Tennessee leads 3-0. That was a pretty good stand by Georgia's defense after Edwards coughed up a fumble on the opening possession. The Volunteers took over at the UGA 47, but the Bulldogs forced a long field goal from UT kicker Chase McGrath. The crowd noise was a factor early; the Volunteers had two false starts on their first possession. -- Mark Schlabach Celebrity sightings Cleveland Browns running back and Georgia alum Nick Chubb and more stars are in the building to watch the Bulldogs battle the Vols. Updates from Sanford As expected, Georgia receiver Adonai Mitchell won't play against the Volunteers. He isn't in uniform for warm-ups. Mitchell, a sophomore from Missouri City, Texas, has been sidelined with an ankle injury and hasn't played since Georgia's 33-0 shutout of Samford on Sept. 10. He had five catches for 69 yards with one score in a 49-3 rout of Oregon in the opener. He is one of Georgia's best deep threats, and quarterback Stetson Bennett could have used him against Tennessee's shaky secondary. -- Schlabach What should you know about the Vols? Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said the Vols should be as healthy as they've been all season. Cedric Tillman, who led Tennessee in receiving last season, figures to provide a boost to an already potent receiving corps. He played limited snaps last week against Kentucky, and Heupel said they had him on a \"pitch count\" after missing the previous four games. Heupel said Tillman will be \"ready to roll\" against the Bulldogs. The 6-foot-3 Tillman creates serious matchup problems with his size and athleticism, particularly with speedy Jalin Hyatt and his 14 touchdowns on the other side. Tillman has been practicing full speed, but the Vols wanted to make sure he was 100 percent before bringing him back for a game. Tillman had tightrope surgery to repair a high ankle sprain in September. -- Chris Low How about them Dawgs? There's no question that Georgia's defense will miss senior outside linebacker Nolan Smith, who led the Bulldogs in sacks, tackles for loss and quarterback hurries. He's a versatile defender who Georgia moved around a lot, and he's one of the team's most experienced players. But the Bulldogs were going to struggle to get pressure on Volunteers quarterback Hendon Hooker regardless. Hooker gets rid of the ball quickly in Tennessee's fast-paced offense. He has tremendous eye discipline and doesn't make many mistakes, which is why he has only one interception this season. Georgia's cornerbacks -- Kelee Ringo and Kamari Lassiter -- are going to have to play well on the perimeter to slow the Vols. They'll face a monumental challenge in trying to contain UT receivers Tillman, Bru McCoy and Hyatt. Georgia coach Kirby Smart said the Bulldogs are going to have to adjust to UT's pace on the fly and do it well. \"They got multiple paces they use and they can go as fast as anybody in the country. They practice it, they preach it, they do a really good job researching themselves and figuring out how they can go faster. And our job is to be able to match that conditioning level.\" -- Schlabach It's on in Athens What might be the biggest game in Sanford Stadium history is still hours away, but thousands of fans have flocked to Athens from every direction. Former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning is here. So is former Georgia defensive back and NFL Hall of Famer Champ Bailey. Country music star Luke Bryan arrived for \"College GameDay\" via private jet. PGA Tour golfers Kevin Kisner, a Georgia alum, and past U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland were expected to arrive from Justin Thomas' wedding in Nashville sometime Saturday morning. The Bulldogs have hosted plenty of big games at Sanford Stadium during the past 93 years, but perhaps none bigger than Saturday's, which will probably decide the SEC East title and who will play in the SEC championship game.

Irving was suspended by the Nets on Thursday night after repeated refusals to apologize, testy exchanges with the media and a lack of dialogue with the organization, reportedly not returning Nets owner Joe Tsai\u2019s texts. Now if Irving wants to play , he\u2019s going to have to meet face-to-face with not only NBA commissioner Adam Silver but Jewish leaders. And the NBPA wants to address the issue with Irving as well, according to Boston Celtics forward Grant Williams, who is \u2013 like Irving \u2013 a union vice president. \u201cI think we will but currently, there are a lot of matters as well,\u201d Williams told MassLive . \u201cI think we\u2019ll get together as a group potentially \u2014 everything has been through the team. It has been not been a league issue to this point. It hasn\u2019t been an NBA/NBPA issue. The Nets and the league have taken care of that and dealing with Kyrie and the process there. We don\u2019t have much control on that matter.\u201d The NBPA has staunchly supported Irving in the past over other situations, and their power could have played a role in the Nets willingly paying Irving for the road games he was sent home for last season while unvaccinated. But they released a statement condemning anti-Semitism and hate speech \u2013 and Irving\u2019s former teammate, LeBron James, expressed the same sentiment . \u201cI don\u2019t condone any hate to any kind. To any race. To Jewish communities, to Black communities, to Asian communities. You guys know where I stand,\u201d James said Friday, adding that his \u201cThe Shop: Uninterrupted\u201d decided not to air an episode featuring Ye, or the former Kanye West, because of hate conversation with the guest. West has repeatedly supported Irving\u2019s recent stance, one controversial enough that Nike suspended its relationship with the Brooklyn point guard.

I believe that you cannot care more about winning the argument than you do about solving the problem. Granite Staters do not care if a solution is a Democratic or Republican idea \u2014 they just care about getting results. And that is the example I follow, working across the aisle on Granite State priorities, fighting to lower costs for families and communities, and working to keep our country safe, secure and free. From helping negotiate the bipartisan infrastructure law to securing a 900% increase in funding for New Hampshire to combat the opioid epidemic, I have seen time and again that the best way to accomplish things is by working together. When Granite Staters told me about facing steep, unexpected medical bills, I stood up to the entire health care industry and teamed up with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana to ban the absurd practice of surprise medical billing. Cynics on both sides say that finding common ground is impossible, but I have proved them wrong. I helped develop and pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which will lower costs and bolster our national security by bringing semiconductor manufacturing back home.

I took on Big Pharma and Big Oil to help pass a landmark law that will bring down prescription drug prices and energy costs. This law finally allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, caps out of pocket medication costs for Medicare recipients, and caps the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month. This will both put money back in the pockets of seniors and will help bring down drug prices for everyone. This law also delivers a tax cut to promote energy efficiency, a bipartisan measure that I crafted which will lower costs for families both in the short and long term by cutting taxes, lowering home energy bills, and making us less reliant on Big Oil and foreign oil. I am also leading a bipartisan push for the Biden administration to release oil from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve to lower home energy costs as we head into winter.

But the state Supreme Court ruling made it more difficult for Nye County officials to revise, submit and get approval for plans and then carry them out for the hand-count.

(AP Photo/Gabe Stern, File) Questions remain over why the observer was removed by an election official who was openly carrying a gun. Nye County lawyers have claimed that the chairman of the county\u2019s GOP Central Committee, who was legally armed, acted as a hand-count volunteer trained by county Interim Clerk Mark Kampf when she confronted the ACLU observer. The GOP chair reportedly believed the ACLU observer was tallying the vote count, which is a violation of the recount rules. EARLY VOTING NUMBERS FROM THIS BLUE STATE SUGGEST IT COULD FLIP RED: REPORT The ACLU has disputed the accusations, and the issue is not expected to be resolved until after the Nov. 8 election, making it unlikely that a hand-count could resume before polls close next week. Cegavske flagged a number of issues she was concerned with regarding the silent-count proposal. \"There are no provisions in your plan describing the required use of medical-style gloves to further mitigate the risk of cheating or accidental marking nor a prescribed and standardized device for tallying to ensure any new mark could be quickly identified,\" she said. Cegavske also expressed concern over the attention it would require each silent counter. Nye County enacted a hand-count process following concerns over election integrity that stem from conspiracy theories relating to the accuracy of ballot-counting machines from the 2020 election.

Voters across the political spectrum weighed in on recent comments regarding crime from New York gubernatorial candidates Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin, with reactions indicating how their stances may impact the upcoming election. New York Democratic Governor Hochul claimed on Sunday that voters' perceptions about crime across the country are actually based on a \"conspiracy\" formulated by the GOP. During an interview on MSNBC with Al Sharpton, Hochul called Republicans \"master manipulators\" trying to convince people that Democratic states are unsafe. \"These are master manipulators. They have this conspiracy going all across America trying to convince people that in Democratic states that they\u2019re not as safe. Well guess what?

It was the first in-person JP conference in New York following postponements because of the pandemic. ((Photo by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)) In a survey that played the video of her remarks and allowed respondents to track their reaction in real time, registered voters evenly split among Democrats (blue line), Republicans (red line) and independents (gray line), had differing perspectives on Hochul\u2019s comments. \"We do not need more politicians voicing a conspiracy theory about hate and crime,\" one independent voter said in reaction to the video. \"Violence is up in democratically and republican run states, and it is insulting to believe that guns are the only problem. I would be in favor of doing away with private citizen ownership of guns because they do little good and much harm.\" \"I get crime is less in democratic areas, but it's still too high and that wasn't addressed,\" a Democratic voter said. One Republican voter said her comments were just \"plain insulting,\" while another said Hochul was \"out of her mind\" if she thinks the data shows a reduction in crime. DEMOCRATIC NYC LAWMAKER BACKS ZELDIN OVER HOCHUL, DEFYING PARTY: 'WE DON'T FEEL SAFE' Video Pollster Lee Carter, who conducted the survey through her company Maslansky + Partners, said that she believes Hochul\u2019s comments could be her \"basket of deplorables\" moment, a reference to Hillary Clinton\u2019s past comments about Donald Trump supporters. \"What she did here is not only fail to address crime, but dismiss it. When she said that data shows that shootings and murders are down by 50% and Republicans are not only election deniers but data deniers\u2014she absolutely lost all credibility with independents and Republicans,\" Carter said. She added that while Democrats respond favorably to attacks on Republicans, independents and Republicans hate it, causing them to retrench and rethink their options at the ballot box. Her opponent, Zeldin, has used crime as the cornerstone of his campaign, making a number of media appearances to discuss lawlessness in the last month. Recently, the gubernatorial candidate appeared on Fox News where he talked about how people\u2019s routines are changing in New York as a response to their increased concerns about violence. \"Maybe they used to ride the subway, and they don\u2019t know. Maybe they used to ride the subway with their yarmulkes on, but now they take it off because they\u2019re afraid of being targeted for being Jewish or for being Sikh, maybe they take their turban off. There are individuals who when they do ride the subway they\u2019re grabbing a pole or guardrail because they\u2019re afraid of being pushed in front of an oncoming subway care,\" Zeldin said. He made note of a variety of different high-profile crimes, including the story of a father who was killed inside a hotel while visiting his daughter for Parents Weekend at Marist College, and a woman who was shot and killed in front of her children.

Snyder has been embroiled in endless controversies as owner \u2014 including alleged sexual misconduct, a toxic workplace and his relationship with other owners. His decision to explore selling the team is an about-face on his recent sentiment, when he remained steadfast in remaining owner. It mirrors his public 180 in regard to the team name, when he first refused to change from the derogatory \u201cRedskins\u201d before doing just that in 2020. Snyder has owned the team since 1999, when he purchased it for $800 million. Forbes currently values the team at $5.6 billion, which would break the record for most expensive NFL team.

Bezos, with a $114 billion estimated net worth as the world\u2019s current fourth-wealthiest individual, already owns the Washington Post locally.

T&C apply. Clemson (8-0) debuted at No. 4 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings. Most projections had Michigan at No. 4 and Clemson at No. 5, but the committee appears to have rewarded the Tigers\u2019 wins over ranked ACC foes Wake Forest, NC State and Syracuse. The Tigers\u2019 last two wins have come by just six points, most recently a 27-21 home win over Syracuse on Oct. 22. Notre Dame (5-3) has recovered from its 0-2 start to the season, though its surprise loss to Marshall may have torpedoed any hopes of sniffing the CFP rankings this year. Notre Dame has nonetheless managed to beat a high-powered North Carolina team, BYU and Syracuse as first-year coach Marcus Freeman has begun to make his imprint on the program. The Tigers are a few seasons removed from the Trevor Lawrence/Travis Etienne glory days now, and they\u2019re no longer smoking every team they see. They may be 8-0, but four of their six conference wins have come by 10 points or fewer. That could be part of the explanation as to why Clemson is only favored by 3.5 points here, and by four points at BetMGM. The other half of it could be Notre Dame\u2019s national brand drawing in excess action. Make Clemson a larger favorite, and the money will come in too one-sided. Take advantage of this while you can. Notre Dame may be able to hang with Clemson early, but big plays on offense are required to keep up with the best teams in the nation, and sophomore quarterback Drew Pyne has few receiving options in that regard. The Irish have relied more on the running game \u2014 Audri Estime and Logan Diggs combined for three touchdowns while Notre Dame racked up 246 rushing yards to beat Syracuse \u2014 but Clemson ranks seventh in FBS in rushing defense, allowing 87.9 yards per game at under 3 yards per attempt. Clemson vs. Notre Dame prediction: Clemson to cover -3.5 @ -115 at Caesars Sportsbook Dabo Swinney insists Clemson doesn\u2019t have a quarterback controversy. Love him or hate him, Swinney is right. DJ Uiagalelei had his toughest outing of the season against Syracuse. He lost a fumble and threw two interceptions before Swinney inserted backup Cade Klubnik, Clemson\u2019s heir apparent at the position. Klubnik was fine, while running back Will Shipley shouldered the load in the second half to ensure Clemson\u2019s victory. But before the Syracuse game, Uiagalelei was showing vast improvement over 2021, most notably tossing five touchdowns to help Clemson put away Wake Forest in double overtime. Now he has the benefit of a bye week between Syracuse and Notre Dame to recharge and refocus. Freeman is a defensive-minded coach and Notre Dame is fine against the pass, but Uiagalelei can go off at any moment \u2014 just as he did in his first major action as a college player, when Lawrence missed the 2020 regular-season showdown with COVID-19 and Uiagalelei threw for 439 yards and two touchdowns in a 2OT loss. Combine all this with the fact that this is not a vintage Clemson defense keeping teams under 10 points a game, and we consider this a very exploitable over/under total. Clemson vs. Notre Dame prediction: Over 44 total points @ -110 with Caesars Sportsbook Clemson\u2019s offense has been taking time to warm up. Not only did they score 17 of their 27 points against Syracuse in the second half, they notched 21 of their 31 against Boston College and 17 of their 30 against NC State after halftime. The Tigers have also outscored their opponents in the second half six times in eight games, and always by more than a couple points. If Notre Dame has to play catch-up in this game \u2014 and we believe it will \u2014 Pyne and the Irish offense haven\u2019t shown they can manage that. In four of their five wins, they\u2019ve struck early and built a healthy lead by halftime before holding on. The lone comeback win came against lowly Cal. Their biggest chunk plays tend to go to NFL tight end prospect Michael Mayer, who will be well-accounted for in Swinney\u2019s gameplan. In short, Clemson will bag this one in the second half.

Bettman's comments came a day after the Bruins announced they signed Miller, a prospect defenseman, to an entry-level contract. Miller was a fourth-round pick by the Arizona Coyotes in 2020 until his draft rights were relinquished after a story was published about how he and another classmate were convicted of assaulting and bullying a Black developmentally disabled classmate. The report revealed how Miller, now 20, and another middle school classmate were convicted in juvenile court in 2016 for racially abusing and bullying Isaiah Meyer-Crothers. In the report, Meyer-Crothers' mother alleged Miller began abusing her son in second grade and repeatedly used racist slurs. Bettman said what he had heard anecdotally and understood through media reports about what Miller did was \"reprehensible, unacceptable.\" He said the Bruins did not consult the league but he has since spoken with team president Cam Neely. \"He's not coming into the NHL, he's not eligible at this point to come into the NHL,\" Bettman said. \"I can't tell you that he'll ever be eligible to come into the NHL. If in fact at some point they think they want him to play in the NHL -- and I'm not sure they're anywhere close to that point -- we're going to have to clear him and his eligibility and it'll be based on all the information that we get firsthand at the time.\" Bettman said the Bruins were free to sign Miller to play somewhere else, a reference to the fact Miller was sent to play for the Bruins' AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. But then added that, \"nobody should think at this point he is or may ever be NHL eligible and the Bruins understand that now.\" Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron, forward Nick Foligno and coach Jim Montgomery addressed the situation with Miller following morning skate in Toronto ahead of their game against the Maple Leafs. \"The culture we built here goes against that type of behavior,\" Bergeron told reporters. \"We're a team built with character and character people. What he did is unacceptable, and we don't stand by that. In this locker room, we are all about inclusion, diversity, respect. Those are key words and core values that we have. \"We expect guys to wear this jersey to be high-character people with integrity and respect. Hopefully there is growth and change.\" Bergeron said if Miller is the same person he was as the 14-year-old who bullied Meyer-Crothers, that \"he would not be accepted and wanted and welcomed.\" He said the Bruins' culture is not going to change and the changes \"are from the individual himself.\" Foligno said it was \"a tough thing\" for the team to hear after learning the Bruins had signed Miller. \"I'm not going lie to you,\" Foligno said. \"I don't think any guy was too happy because of how proud we are to say that this is a group that cares a lot about ourselves and how we carry ourselves and how we treat people.\" Montgomery, who is in his first season with the team, said he does not know Miller but added what he did was \"a reprehensible act\" and that it is up to Miller to show everyone that he is doing the right things going forward.

No matter how bad things become in the nation, reality has no purchase on the ideological bubble of this White House.", "content": "The Biden Administration will be known to history for many things: an open border and its deadly consequences , the abandonment of Afghanistan , weakness that led to catastrophe in Europe, skyrocketing inflation , and the use of federal law enforcement to target political opponents. The catalog of infamy goes on. Above all, though, this administration may be remembered for its duplicity \u2014 its continual, shameless \u201cgaslighting\u201d of the American people. Biden, his team, and his sycophantic media supporters repeatedly tell us that \u201call is well\u201d where it manifestly is not. No matter how bad things become in the nation, no matter how many people suffer, reality has no purchase on the ideological bubble of this White House. That is why, in these midterm elections, the American people must deliver to Joe Biden an unequivocal message: that they refuse to be gaslit, that they are not buying what he is selling. Biden and his staff spin not simply to be optimistic. They do so to cover up the often deadly consequences of their policy decisions. This is certainly the case as regards Biden\u2019s open border. The president\u2019s reversal of Trump-era border enforcement, and his effective encouragement of illegal border crossings, has led to widespread human suffering. Migrants have been dying in record numbers as they make their journeys, often under the control of coyotes and human smugglers. Americans are dying , too, as toxic fentanyl pours into the nation . What do Biden and his aides have to say about all this? Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki insisted that the Biden border disaster was not a \u201ccrisis,\u201d but rather a \u201cchallenge.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris has gone further, stating that \u201c the border is secure .\u201d As Biden\u2019s Afghanistan withdrawal policy went into effect, and as the Taliban reconquered that country, the American people were treated to a veritable buffet of gaslit falsehood. The president assured us, despite the evidence, that Taliban victory was \u201c highly unlikely .\u201d Psaki confidently declared that Afghan forces \u201c have what they need .\u201d Spin of this sort did nothing to stop the Taliban, to prevent the deaths of 13 American service members, or to save the lives of Afghan civilians. It did nothing, either, to discourage the aggression of Vladimir Putin. America under Biden was weak , Putin reasoned , and thus the time was right for Russia to invade Ukraine. Given Biden\u2019s record, midterm voters must resist the election-time duplicity of Democratic candidates. Democrats who claim to be \u201cindependent\u201d of the national party, or who hedge their support for Biden, should be challenged. For example, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly claims to have been critical of Biden\u2019s border policy. But, as his opponent Blake Masters noted , Kelly in fact \u201cvoted for more IRS agents, not more Border Patrol agents\u201d when given the chance. Then there is New York Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s recent crime-focused campaign ad. Hochul, the ad proclaims, wants \u201c a safer New York .\u201d But in her recent debate with Republican Lee Zeldin \u2014 a candidate committed to ending New York\u2019s cashless bail and other soft-on-crime Democratic policies \u2014 Hochul slipped and shared her real thoughts, wondering aloud why the issue was \u201c so important \u201d to her opponent. In Pennsylvania, where debate continues over Democrat John Fetterman\u2019s health and fitness for office, one thing remains certain: Fetterman will double-deal on the issues most important to voters. After all, he was against fracking before he was for it . And he is \u201cfor\u201d it now only because there is an election on the line. As for suggestions that his opponent Dr. Mehmet Oz himself flip-flopped on fracking, Oz strongly denies the charge . More importantly, voters recognize the difference between a novice politician moving towards his party\u2019s consensus on a key issue, and a career politician conveniently shifting away from his own party\u2019s stance. It is not difficult to guess how each man would vote should he reach the Senate. Any Democrat claiming divergence from the national platform \u2014 on the border, crime, fracking, or any other issue \u2014 is allowed to do so only for electoral advantage, and usually only during election season. When the crucial moments arrive, when the votes are most needed for the Biden agenda, they will finally be there. For evidence, look no further than the most \u201cindependent\u201d Democrat in Washington, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. After opposing Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d bill, Manchin nonetheless caved to the president\u2019s extravagant spending with his vote for the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2014 a law that will reduce nothing other than the solvency of the nation . In 2022, the notion of \u201cvoting for the person, not the party\u201d is a luxury voters can no longer afford. A vote to send a Democrat to Congress, or to send a Democrat to a governor\u2019s mansion or, for that matter, to state houses and state courts, is almost surely a vote for this president and his agenda. For America to begin changing course, midterm voters must see beyond the spin, listen beyond the gaslighting, and reject this president along with the candidates who support him.

His story, excerpted from his \u201cfictionalized\u201d book \u201cAnswered Prayers,\u201d was so venomous, Ann took her own life at her apartment in 1133 Fifth Ave.", "content": "It\u2019s a story that starts with a bang. \u201cTURFMAN KILLED BY WIFE IN DARK\u201d read the cover of The New York Times on Oct. 31, 1955. The turfman was Billy Woodward Jr., 35, the owner of the famed racehorse Nashua, international playboy, and son of the renowned financier William Woodward Sr. The wife was Ann Woodward, 40, a Kansas hick success story: She climbed the nightclub hoochie-coochie ladder straight into the lap of her Manhattan millionaire husband \u2014 and his father. On Oct 30, around 2 a.m. at their Oyster Bay mansion, Ann heard her miniature poodle Sloppy bark followed by a strange noise. Fearing the return of a serial burglar who had been terrorizing the upscale community, she picked up the double-barrel Churchill \u201cImperial\u201d model side-lock ejector shotgun she kept by her bed, stepped into the darkness and fired. At the end of the hall, the naked body of her husband fell limp into a pool of blood. Not since Harry Kendall Thaw murdered Stanford White over Evelyn Nesbit had a society shooting been so scandalous. For many, especially her mother-in-law, Ann was always a stain on the Woodward family name. Other women called her a gold digger. There were rumors that she had sex with men for money and gifts during her days as a \u201cbunny girl\u201d at Fefe\u2019s Monte Carlo at 49 East 54th St. She did \u2014 it\u2019s where she first met Billy, after all. Some knew she had been a mistress to William Woodward Sr. before marrying Billy. Others knew that the Woodward family patriarch had put her up to taking Billy\u2019s virginity to offset rumors that he had a homosexual yen. Those who had hunted tigers with Ann in India knew that she was dangerous with guns. Those who had lunched with her at La C\u00f4te Basque at 60 West 55th St. knew that she was staring down the barrel of a volcanic divorce. They knew that Billy had a voracious sexual appetite and carried out his affairs (with women) in public. They knew that their relationship was often violent. She was in danger of losing her children. Nassau County authorities ruled that Billy Woodward\u2019s death an accident. But for the voluble members of New York\u2019s cafe society, she was guilty de facto. She had signed her divorce papers in lead. For 20 years, literary superstar and \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d author Truman Capote slurped up the scuttlebutt like his vodka-heavy screwdrivers. For just as long, Ann had tried to disappear \u2014 quietly bopping between Europe and Manhattan. Then in 1975, Capote regurgitated the whisperings in an excerpt from his long-delayed book \u201cAnswered Prayers\u201d with such venom that Ann took her own life at her apartment in 1133 Fifth Ave. ahead of publication. \u201cOnce a tramp, always a tramp,\u201d Lady Ina Coolbirth, Capotes\u2019 stand-in for socialite Slim Keith, says of a not-at-all veiled caricature of Ann in the chapter titled \u201cLa C\u00f4te Basque, 1965,\u201d which first appeared in Esquire. Keith, once one of Capote\u2019s most beloved \u201cswans,\u201d never spoke to him again after publication. \u2018Once a tramp, always a tramp . . . Of course it wasn\u2019t an accident. She\u2019s a murderess.\u2019 The insults continue like machine-gun fire. Billy was a naive \u201canal-oriented Episcopalian\u201d and \u201cnot at all caf\u00e9 society.\u201d Ann is \u201ca jazzy little carrot-top killer\u201d \u201cbrought up in some country-slum way\u201d and \u201ca call girl for a pimp who was a bell captain at the Waldorf\u201d who \u201csaved her money and took voice lessons and dance lessons and ended up as the favorite lay of one of Frankie Costello\u2019s shysters.\u201d \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d Lady Coolbirth continues. \u201cShe\u2019s a murderess.\u201d The story \u2014 which threw under-the-belt punches in trashy, low-brow prose at practically all of Capote\u2019s nearest and dearest (including socialites Babe Paley, C.Z. Guest, Slim Keith and Lee Radziwill) \u2014 was a flippant act of destruction done in cold blood. The fallout was legendary and the unfinished novel would only be published in 1986, two years after Capote\u2019s death. In \u201cDeliberate Cruelty\u201d (out Nov. 11 with Atria Books), author Roseanne Montillo takes a fresh stab at one of New York\u2019s best remembered killings, its decades-long ripple effect and Capote\u2019s failed final literary project. While reams of analysis of Ann\u2019s pulpy affair have been offered over the years \u2014 it was the inspiration for \u201cThe Two Mrs. Grenvilles\u201d by Dominick Dunne \u2014 Montillo takes a biographical path to answering an enduring question: What drove Capote to attack Ann \u2014 not to mention his closest friends \u2014 in \u201cAnswered Prayers\u201d? \u201cIt is possible that Truman Capote loathed the socialite Ann Woodward because she reminded him so much of his mother,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut he may also have been so cruel to her because Ann Woodward seemed too much like him as well.\u201d Like Ann, Capote was born into poverty. Like Ann, Capote spent much of his formative years living in a rural American backwater with relatives. Like Ann, Capote and his mother, Lillie Mae, were fascinated by New York high society \u2014 and neither Ann nor Lillie Mae were above using wealthy men to get what they wanted. Their mothers both met tragic ends: Capote\u2019s mother committed suicide, while Ann\u2019s hard-lived mother died from a rare form of TB usually found in cattle. Most importantly, they both had the skills and cunning to rise into a society that would never fully accept them. \u201cTruman Streckfus Persons [later Truman Capote] resembled Ann Woodward more than he cared to admit, and their lives ran on parallel tracks from beginning to end,\u201d she writes. But despite their similarities, Capote was never close with Ann Woodward. They were connected via friends of friends at best. When they did meet, according to Montillo, it was like dropping a pair of Siamese fighting fish in a water glass. In 1956, just one year after the death of her husband, Capote spied Ann dining at the Palace Hotel in St. Moritz, and to his surprise she was hardly a picture of the widow in mourning. She was dining cozily with the well-known playboy Claus von B\u00fclow, a man with \u201ca past as colorful as her own, if not more so.\u201d \u201cThe rumors surrounding him were dark: that he was a necrophile; that he had killed his mother and stashed her body on ice; that somehow, he was still embroiled in espionage; that as a youth he had attended Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s wedding,\u201d Montillo writes, noting that later in 1982, he would be convicted of the attempted murder of his wife Sunny. Intrigued by her audacity, Capote approached Ann. \u201cAs he arrived at the table, Ann immediately got up from her chair, angry that she should have been disturbed during her meal. A short conversation followed, during which, apparently, Ann called Truman \u2018a little fag,\u2019\u201d Montillo writes. \u201cHe returned the slur by wagging his finger at her and calling her \u2018Mrs. Bang Bang,\u2019 a moniker that would stick to her for the rest of her days.\u201d Truman gossiped about the encounter for years afterward. When word got back to Ann that Capote was talking about her, she called him \u201ca little toad.\u201d What may have been a friendship forged in otherness was now a war of words \u2014 one for which Capote spent years building his arsenal. In 1979, several years after the fallout from the Esquire story and Ann\u2019s consequent death, a drug- and alcohol-hardened Capote appeared on \u201cThe Stanley Siegel Show\u201d in Manhattan and quipped: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something about fags, especially southern fags. We is mean. A southern fag is meaner than the meanest rattler. . . .

I\u2019m jealous, envious and more than a little resentful. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t have nice things. Throughout this World Series you had the option to save your sanity by eliminating the sound of Fox\u2019s John Smoltz\u2019s relentless, sleep-inspiring pitching recipe recitals that reduced the Series to a late night curative for enjoyment. I was, however, stuck with him, like a schnook assigned to cover the annual Diet Ginger Ale Festival in Lambertville, N.J. As Groucho Marx, in the role of Professor Wagstaff, told the audience in the 1932 movie \u201cHorse Feathers\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay here, but there\u2019s no reason why you folks shouldn\u2019t go out into the lobby until this thing blows over.\u201d As the insufferable comes with the annual understanding that it defies treatment and defines neglect, Fox again proved there is only one party that finds Smoltz both irreplaceable, unredeemable and irresistible: the head shot-caller at Fox. Again, this Series, there wasn\u2019t even evidence that Fox suggested to Smoltz that he take even one pitch off from being the guy no one wants to sit beside. Reader Larry Trent suggests that MLB is instituting a pitch clock only to limit \u201cSmoltz\u2019s interminable dissection of every pitch and release point.\u201d Hadn\u2019t thought of that. And the four-seam spin rate is apparently directly proportionate to viewers\u2019 audio exit velocities. If the pitch is swung at and missed, Smoltz delivers a scientific, microscopic tribute to the pitcher. If it\u2019s hit, an autopsy follows. But to his credit, Smoltz doesn\u2019t cause headaches; he causes brown-outs, make the lights dim. He saves us money on our electric bills. Surely, he must say something worth hearing over three-plus hours, but that has been drowned in his vat of dreary stew within minutes of the national anthem. The sorriest part is that Smoltz is no better and no different from his first day in Fox\u2019s booth in 2014. He still operates under the misconception that he should describe and examine every pitch until, somewhere in the second inning, we no longer pay attention. But Fox\u2019s overall productions were no easier on the better baseball senses. Crowd shots \u2014 endless, countless, redundant crowd shots \u2014 supplanted the logical design to televise World Series baseball. Runners on base? Who cares where the defense is playing? The length of a runner\u2019s lead? No extra charge for inattention to game circumstances. Fox, again, will scour the stands to find an overly wrought woman, her hands clasped in despair or prayer, awaiting the next pitch as if on the precipice of madness. It\u2019s part of all networks\u2019 plan to best serve those least likely to be watching. Of course, the one \u201cplay\u201d Fox paid closest attention to wasa bat flip by Houston\u2019s Kyle Tucker after he hit his second home run in Game 1. Fox made sure to show that several times, and at least once in slow-motion. Though Tucker\u2019s team lost the game, that move is now the essence of televised baseball. But why, in 2022, would we have expected better? For all the NFL rules designed to protect players from needless injury, among the most indefensible and inexcusably dangerous \u201ctackles\u201d remains ignored \u2014 and technically legal. You\u2019ve seen it countless times, but let\u2019s use the Patriots-Jets game last week on CBS as an example. Pats QB Mac Jones was forced to run. He sprinted toward the far sideline. Heading out of bounds to avoid a hit, he couldn\u2019t have stopped if he tried. But as he was about to step out of bounds, defensive back D.J. Reed lowered his shoulder and blasted Jones. No flag \u2014 it was a legal hit, because Jones was still in-bounds by inches \u2014 but a sideline hassle, naturally, erupted as the Jets celebrated Reed\u2019s brutal hit as if he\u2019d done something special other than creamed canned corn. All Reed needed to do was nudge, push or, at most, shove Jones, and he\u2019d have been out of bounds. After Bears wide receiver N\u2019Keal Harry caught a short touchdown pass in man-to-man coverage against the Cowboys last Sunday, Fox\u2019s Daryl \u201cMoose\u201d Johnston gave it the Moose Johnston replay treatment, meaning he spoke an endless stream of genuine gridiron gibberish: \u201cNow here is [DB] Kelvin Joseph right here (Johnston circled him with his telestrator). Now, he has no help to the left. He is playing heavy outside leverage in their coverage. \u201cThere is nobody to his left. He has no help on that side. Don\u2019t know why he was playing such heavy leverage to the side of the field where he had some help.\u201d Got that? The replay simply showed Harry making a quick, tight move to the outside, Joseph doing a pretty good job sticking with him, and QB Justin Fields hitting Harry with a nice, tight pass. Heavy leverage? That was Harry\u2019s first TD catch since 2020. Previously this season, he\u2019d caught one pass. Was Johnston advocating double coverage? If so, who would he have left in single coverage or uncovered? Or was Johnston just eager to use the term \u201cheavy leverage,\u201d whatever it meant? But now in its 20th season of throwing Johnston at us, Fox surely knows what it\u2019s doing. So, The Eagles-Texans NFL game and the NHL\u2019s Rangers-Bruins game on Thursday night were both the exclusive viewing property of streaming networks. Brilliant marketing. Those who pay for the Rangers over MSG were given the cool breeze. More to come, a la the Yankees and Mets this past season. This is known as teaching fans to live without \u2014 abandoning longtime detovees to cast bait among the young. Look what pay-per-view did for boxing.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! A century ago, my grandparents boarded an ocean liner in eastern Europe . They took only what they could carry with them, and left behind everything they had known. I can only wonder what they thought as they took one last look at the only place they called home. There was no telling what they would find across the ocean, but they trusted the promise of America. With years of hard work they achieved the promise of the American Dream and this opportunity has been passed down for generations. Unfortunately, the American Dream is under attack and I am running for Congress to defend it for future generations and ensure our kids have a shot at success\u2013just like I did. My grandfather got his start by founding a business called Silberline Manufacturing. Through innovation and grit, he created hundreds of good-paying manufacturing jobs for Pennsylvanians. Our family-owned business has been passed on for generations and today, I am proud to serve as the President to continue employing the next generation of workers in our communities. There have also been some tough times in the process. As a young woman growing up in the small town of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, I experienced some of the same struggles with addiction that so many are currently facing in our communities. When I was 38 years old, my older brother passed away and left the family business to me. Ever since, I have worked tirelessly to give back to my community, never forgetting the courage and hard work of my grandfather. I\u2019ve grown the company, which is the only one of its kind in the United States and I am now 40 years sober from drugs and alcohol. In an effort to help others struggling with addiction, I started a non-profit to employ addicts in early recovery and funded scholarships to help local community college students pursue their education. FINAL COUNTDOWN: HERE'S WHAT'S AT STAKE IN NEXT WEEK'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS Lisa Scheller is the 2022 GOP nominee in Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District, one of the most competitive House districts in the country (National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC)) I\u2019ve done this because I believe in the American dream. How couldn\u2019t I? In most of the world, my family\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t be possible. It\u2019s a permanent reminder to me that this country really is the best on earth, and that we need to protect it. Unfortunately, that dream has come under attack. The truth is, there are too many career politicians in Washington who have lost sight of the American Dream and are putting it out of reach for the next generation. They would rather spew talking points and appease a small section of their supporters rather than solve the pressing issues facing America. In the fever dreams of these radicals, defunding the police is justice, exorbitant spending is prosperity, and open borders are progress. FOX NEWS POLL: POLARIZATION DEFINES THE MIDTERM ELECTION Early voting in Pennsylvania. (Fox News) Today, young Americans are losing faith in the American dream as they see opportunities dwindle in a stagnant economy; Seniors are seeing their life savings eaten away by skyrocketing inflation and out-of-control energy costs; Whole communities are being devastated by Chinese fentanyl that\u2019s pouring across an open border; Small business owners worry about protecting what they have as our cities experience a surge in crime; and parents worry for children who lost years off their educations due to heavy-handed lockdowns. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can have a safer, happier, and more prosperous America if we turn away from those who constantly seek to redefine America in a way that has made too many of us pessimistic and cynical. All we need are leaders who will allow Americans to do what they do best \u2013 create, innovate, and achieve. A SIMPLE GUIDE TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS, HOW THEY AFFECT THE PRESIDENCY, AND MORE A voter arrives to cast their mail-in ballot at the City-County Building in Pennsylvania. I\u2019m running for Congress to be one of those leaders. My family has lived out the American dream, and it\u2019s time to fight for it in Washington so that our children can have the same opportunities as I had. I\u2019ll take my experience as a business owner and engineer with me to Washington and get to work on addressing the issues we\u2019re facing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER I\u2019ll take on the wasteful spending, help open up our domestic energy, secure the border, and support our police. I\u2019ll do this because I\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019m a problem solver, and I\u2019m ready to take on the mess in Washington and get to work for the people of Pennsylvania. So, if you want someone who will fight for families, stand up to the radical left, and work to save the American dream, I hope I can count on your support.

It\u2019s a Christmas romcom about romance blooming on the set of a Christmas romcom! John Brotherton ( The Christmas Contest ) plays the film\u2019s quasi-conceited star and Kimberley Sustad ( The Nine Kittens of Christmas ) plays a local retailer who gets roped into the production as a costume designer. Will this meta movie about a movie get a round of holiday cheers, or does Lights, Camera, Christmas merit two thumbs down? The Gist: Kimberley Sustad plays Kerry, former fashion designer and current owner of a vintage clothing store. With her business in a rut and rent well past due, Kerry jumps at the chance to sell her entire inventory \u2014 including a number of pieces she designed herself \u2014 to a Christmas movie that\u2019s filming in her hometown of Twelve Oaks, Colorado. When the movie\u2019s costumer gets poached by a Matt Damon feature, the production brings Kerry on full-time \u2014 and you better believe sparks start to fly between her and the film\u2019s handsome leading man and king of Christmas movies, Brad Baxter (John Brotherton). But when opportunity knocks, will Kerry take a chance on dreams she deferred long ago? Or will she get swept up in a Hollywood romance? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: The clash of celebrity and regular folk feels reminiscent of this year\u2019s Jennifer Lopez/Owen Wilson romcom Marry Me . Surprisingly, a lot of this film \u2014 specifically the dynamic between Sustad and Laura Soltis, who plays her mother \u2014 feels like the super smart and off-kilter NBC comedy Great News . But really, Lights, Camera, Christmas delivers moments that are pure old Hollywood, which is really what Hallmark does best. Performance Worth Watching: In a cast of standouts, you gotta give this to Laura Soltis. Her performance as a holiday movie superfan and perpetually on mom is wonderful and, like I mentioned, reminds me a lot of the great Andrea Martin. Memorable Dialogue: When Kerry\u2019s mom Nancy lists Brad Baxter\u2019s filmography: The Christmas Clock , Hello Christmas , Chattanooga Christmas , and \u2014 the best of the bunch \u2014 There\u2019s No Christmas Like Snow Christmas . And the movie within the movie is titled My Favorite Santa , and it\u2019s an exclusive for the streaming service Dazzle+. All of this is perfect parody. A Holiday Tradition: Twelve Oaks, Colorado caught the attention of a holiday movie production because of its annual tree-lighting ceremony (and the smart maneuvering of a mayor who knows that turning Twelve Oaks into a filming destination will help the local economy). Two Turtle Doves: In HBO Max\u2019s A Hollywood Christmas (Dec. 1), a director who specializes in holiday romcoms realizes that she\u2019s stuck in a holiday romcom. Sounds like a totally meta double feature is in order a month from now. Does the Title Make Any Sense?: Yeah, although it is kinda generic. Costuming Christmas or We Wish You a Merry Costume or Walking in a Wardrobe Wonderland \u2014 yeah, these are worse than Brad Baxter\u2019s movie titles. The title is solid. Our Take: Well, this just works . It\u2019s really apparent that Lights, Camera, Christmas is gonna be a different kind of Hallmark movie from the beginning, which is the first part of a framing sequence set a post-screening Q&A with the cast and crew of Dazzle+\u2019s My Favorite Santa . The script\u2019s meta touch is just right, proving that the movie knows how to poke fun at the tropes while still engaging with most of them. First, I have to give it up to Kimberley Sustad and John Brotherton, two of Hallmark\u2019s heaviest-hitters who elevate what\u2019s already a solid script into something truly endearing. Brotherton plays Brad with a cockiness that feels just as natural as his charm. And, because Brad has a real arc to his story, Brotherton is really able to create a character with the kind of layers you rarely see in these movies. The same definitely goes for Sustad\u2019s Kerry, whose yearning for opportunities that whizzed by long ago is, uh, extremely relatable and maybe too real for a Hallmark movie. But Sustad, like Brotherton, plays the full range of Kerry\u2019s emotions. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s put upon, she\u2019s in over her head but she\u2019s making it work! What\u2019s really special about Lights, Camera, Christmas , though, is the unexpected bond that Kerry and Brad form \u2014 and it\u2019s formed not via meet cute or deception or scheme or rivalry, but from these two characters talking and interacting like actual people. They have similar aspirations \u2014 aspirations that the movie doesn\u2019t shy away from! This is a Hallmark movie where career opportunities are just as important as romantic ones! Not that the romance is lackluster, not at all. Their date in a living room set on a soundstage made me feel like I was watching Turner Classic Movies for a hot sec. Lights, Camera, Christmas could have easily earned praise by just riffing on the schmaltzy goofiness of Hallmark movies and relying on Sustad and Brotherton\u2019s incredible chemistry. Instead, it does all of that and gives viewers a little something to think about and feel about. Our Call: STREAM IT.

Mohammed Choudhary and Boysin Lorick have been forced to deal with the city\u2019s backlogged Housing Court to oust those living in the crumbling trio of Neptune Avenue homes, despite being threatened and assaulted by the occupants and repeated calls to the NYPD, according to a lawsuit. Meanwhile, they could face more than $370,000 in fines from the city Buildings Department for illegal occupancy and other violations , records show. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mess and it\u2019s a very dangerous situation,\u201d a frustrated Choudhary told The Post. The pair, who make up 35 NEP LLC, bought 3506, 3508, and 3514 Neptune Ave. in May 2019 for $1.3 million as an investment, they said. At the time, Peter Fonseca, 45, was living in the garage behind 3508 and refusing to leave, the landlords said in court papers. Fonseca was arrested in October 2019 for sexual abuse of a minor, court records show. The arrest enabled the landlords to lock up the homes. Then COVID-19 shutdowns had the owners stranded out of town for months in 2020 and left the homes vulnerable. When the owners returned in September 2020, they found Fonseca back \u2014 along with several strangers who claimed Fonseca was their landlord. \u201cYou have no business here. These buildings belong to us now,\u201d Fonseca allegedly told Lorick, according to the litigation. Choudhary, 70, and Lorick, 75, charge Fonseca and his \u201ctenants\u201d have threatened and assaulted them. There have been six arrests, including for domestic assault and drug possession, in or in front of 3508 between May 2019 and Nov. 3, and nearly 150 calls to 911 regarding 3508 and 3514 Neptune for the same time period, police said. The NYPD has declined to clear the squatters, referring Choudhary and Lorick to civil court after Fonseca claimed to have been living there for months.

Never miss a story. Meanwhile, the Buildings Department slapped the real landlords with $37,000 in penalties, and they face a possible additional $370,000 charge. \u201cNow we can\u2019t do anything and we tried to go to DOB to explain to them and they said it\u2019s not their problem,\u201d Lorick claimed. An occupant of one of the garbage-strewn homes declined to comment Thursday. On Nov. 1, a Brooklyn Housing Court judge finally sided with Choudhary and Lorick, agreeing that Fonseca should be booted later this month. The pair are now suing the city in Brooklyn Supreme Court, seeking a court order to get the violations paused and for either the NYPD or DOB agents to accompany them while they try to access the homes. \u201cThis lawsuit is a plea for help to the very city agencies who unjustly and unfairly continue to fine a landlord who has done everything possible to get access to its own premises for purposes of curing violations they didn\u2019t even cause,\u201d said attorney Natraj Bhushan, who reps the landlords. Owners have a \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to keep their properties safe, said a Buildings Department spokesman, who noted 35 NEP LLC will have a chance to argue its case at upcoming appearances in front of OATH, or the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. \u201cThe owners of these properties will be able to present a defense at the upcoming violation hearings, which will be considered by a court hearing officer when adjudicating the violations. DOB has not yet been served with this lawsuit. We will review the suit, once we have been served,\u201d the spokesman said. Fonseca has been in and out of state prison since 1997 on charges like car theft, assault, and attempted robbery. In June, Fonseca was convicted and sentenced to a year in jail in the sexual abuse case, in which he allegedly twice molested a girl under 17. In September, he was indicted for attempted murder for allegedly acting as the getaway driver in March for another man, Anthony Johnson, who opened fire on a rival in Brooklyn and missed. Fonseca, who pleaded not guilty, is being held on $300,000 cash bail, a $500,000 bond. A criminal attorney for Fonseca said he was unaware of the squatter allegations, and declined comment.

Chris already had two children, Logan, now 12, and Ryan, now 11, from a previous relationship, so when the couple welcomed Liam in February 2014, the family quickly filled a car. Amanda went on to have twin girls, Mya and Mia, in May 2015, and twin boys, Asher and Brycen, in January 2017. Wanting to keep growing their sweet family, Amanda gave birth to Eli in November 2018 and Emma in July 2020. Even then, the Sellerses weren\u2019t done. The family from Roanoke, Va., is now expecting No. 10 to arrive in January. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a year I wasn\u2019t pregnant from 2013 to 2020,\u201d the stay-at-home mom told SWNS. \u201cI think 2021 is the only year I haven\u2019t been.\u201d But that\u2019s not a complaint from Amanda, who said, \u201cI\u2019m very happy with our family size. Ten is a great number. \u201cWe think this might be our last baby, but we\u2019re keeping an open mind for more.\u201d To manage her super-sized family, Amanda follows a coordinated system. She plans the meals for a month and does a big grocery shop that costs around $1,100. She said she spends an additional $400 per month for fresh supplies each week. \u201cI plan about 15 dinners and then double them,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan out the exact days we have the meals, but I make sure we have enough.

Jack Beaumont (not his real name) is a former operative in the clandestine operations branch of the French foreign secret service, known as the DGSE. Speaking to news.com.au\u2019s podcast, I\u2019ve Got News For You , Beaumont explained that the job required him to have five false identities on the go at all times, and detailed the incredible effort it took to maintain them all. \u201cIf it\u2019s an ID you use to try to recruit a human source, and it\u2019s a long-term manipulation, then the ID has to be quite solid,\u201d Beaumont told podcast host Andrew Bucklow. That meant that each false identity had to have a social media presence and a different address. \u201cEvery one of those IDs have to be, if necessary, dismantled in 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can\u2019t just rent a flat because you will leave a trace of payment. \u201cYou have to find some place in Paris or in the countryside where you have some empty flats and then you\u2019re going to make them yours. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna change the name on the mailbox, change the name on the doorbell and then you\u2019re gonna put up some cameras.\u201d Beaumont said he then had to familiarise himself with the locals in each area, so that his false identities would stand up to scrutiny if people came checking. \u201cThe people around this address, they have to know you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to know your face is associated with this name because if someone wants to check, they\u2019re gonna come around to this address and ask the coffee shop or the pharmacy with a picture of you asking, \u2018Do you know this person?\u2019 \u201cSo those people have to know you with this false name and have to be able to say, \u2018Yeah, I know him, he lives around the block.\u2019\u201d That meant Beaumont had to put in the face time to spread his fake backstory. \u201cYou have to spend some time in your false area and have a chat with the owner of the coffee shop, and make sure that they do really remember you under this false ID, giving them your bulls\u2013t life,\u201d he said. He said if one of his false identities was ever compromised, he would have to immediately create a new one. \u201cThose five IDs allow you to do between 10 to 15 different approaches and missions at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you burn one, then you recreate the fifth one immediately so that you always have five different IDs which you can turn to.\u201d Beaumont, who worked for the DGSE for more than 10 years before quitting due to the mental toll, also detailed what effect the job had on his social life. \u201cThey [DGSE] basically tell you to nominate five friends that you can really trust and talk to [about what you do for a living],\u201d he said. \u201cThey do background checks on your friends and then they give you the green light or not to talk to them. \u201cBut the issue is when you go and see your friends and say, \u2018This is what I actually do, and \u2018The Company\u2019 (DGSE) had to do a background check on your life,\u2019 usually it\u2019s not very well taken by those friends. \u201cYou end up losing your friends anyway because they think that you\u2019ve been lying to them already for years and that, without authorization, you did a background check on them and their private life.\u201d Beaumont has since left the DGSE and now lives in Australia with his wife and children.

Two years ago, Democrat Joe Biden beat Republican Donald Trump in large part because he promised a calmer political climate and claimed he would work across the aisle to achieve bipartisan change. But when the former vice president kicked off his presidency on Day One by shutting down the Keystone Pipeline, many who put him in office were concerned. Their worries deepened when he botched our exit from Afghanistan in August 2021. And, this year, when he called skyrocketing inflation \u201c transitory ,\u201d lots of voters decided it was time for new leadership in the midterm elections on Nov. 8. The Cook Political Report predicts Republicans will win as many as 25 seats in the House of Representatives, reclaiming control of the chamber. In the Senate, RealClearPolitics projects the GOP will pick up three seats, in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, and also keep their seats in Ohio and Pennsylvania, wresting control from the Democrats, who currently hold just a one-vote advantage. Meanwhile, in gubernatorial elections in 36 states, several Democratic incumbents look vulnerable against GOP challengers, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and even blue-leaning New York. The much-anticipated Georgia rematch between Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams appears headed toward a landslide for Kemp. But the biggest statewide upset could happen in Oregon, where Democrat Tina Kotek is trailing Republican Christine Drazan amid widespread dissatisfaction over failed progressive policies. Ultimately, the results will be decided by the voters in America\u2019s swing counties, where support shifts easily between both parties. Take Erie County in Pennsylvania. In 2008 and 2012 Barack Obama won this county easily; Trump won it narrowly in 2016. In 2020, Biden only just bested Trump. Then last year, a Republican won the countywide executive race for the first time in decades. This year, Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz is running against Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman for the US Senate in Pennsylvania, in a nail-biting \u201c toss-up \u201d race. Since 2020, Fetterman has repeatedly said \u201cwhoever wins Erie, wins Pennsylvania.\u201d That\u2019s why he held his first rally here since suffering a stroke in May, and Oz walked the streets of Erie in October, talking to local business owners and people he met along the way. That\u2019s where I met Fred Rush, 79, who was leaning against the outside wall of Ringo\u2019s Appliances in Erie, his eyes laser-focused on Oz. He told me he was trying to decide whether the candidate\u2019s interactions were expertly staged or natural. Rush is a classic swing voter. For decades, he worked in local government, starting with a Democratic mayor who he reported to for well over a decade. He went on to serve under Democrat and Republican county executives, then another Democratic mayor. He even did a stint for former Gov. Tom Ridge \u2014 an Erie native and a Republican \u2014 as director of his commission on African-American affairs. Rush said he has always voted for people from both parties but this year he is leaning toward Oz. \u201cMy only concern about him is his lack of policy experience,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, he certainly is showing up to the communities that will show him what policies will impact their lives.\u201d Rush said there is a big difference between a political candidate who drops in, does a rally, and then leaves, and one who actually meets with individual voters and listens to them. \u201cWhen people show up in communities, it shows they care,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to come here and listen to those families who live here, the ones impacted by crime, the scourge of drug overdoses, the ones who can\u2019t afford to buy food or pay for their utilities. \u201cThe candidate who stresses on those points wins.\u201d Oz has also got the vote of Emerencia Torma, who owns Hungarian restaurant Huszar in Pittsburgh\u2019s North Side neighborhood. Many pundits thought Republicans like Torma, 65, would not fall in line behind the Trump-backed Oz after he won a bruising primary by just 951 votes . But after months of COVID closures followed by crippling inflation, many Pennsylvania business owners feel fed up and energized to pull the lever for the celebrity doctor. And not just him. \u201cI\u2019m voting Republican. All Republican,\u201d Torma says flatly. Many of her neighbors appear to feel the same way. In the deep-blue 12th Congressional District, where Torma lives, the race between Democratic state Rep. Summer Lee and Republican borough council President Mike Doyle is shockingly close for a seat that has not been held by the GOP in decades. \u2018It\u2019s the uncertainty Democrats have placed in every aspect of our lives and the overreach \u2026\u2019 Crime, drug use and homelessness have something to do with that. A sizable homeless camp has emerged just down the street from Torma\u2019s restaurant. Last month, two innocent women standing at a bus stop in the area got caught in gunfire and were killed . Torma calls the uncertainty of what will happen next \u201cunbearable\u201d at times. \u201cI am not going to give up, my parents came here for freedom and opportunity, that is why I am voting Republican,\u201d said Torma, whose parents immigrated to the US from Hungary in 1956. \u201cThey offer that choice, the Democrats have failed us.\u201d In Sandusky, Mich., Mark Heberling is standing in the middle of his barber shop, Mark\u2019s Barber Shop. In addition to owning this business for 38 years, Heberling, 59, has also run an 80-acre beef farm with his youngest son, Raymond, since 2004. When COVID hit in 2020 and his barbershop got shut down by the state for six weeks, he was desperate. \u201cIt got to the point where my customers were calling me at home. I put a barber chair in my living room and I started cutting hair at home,\u201d he said, adding that the move got him in trouble with local officials and resulted in a fine that was settled out of court. \u201cI ended up taking a number of part-time jobs, just bouncing here and there, for whoever would pay me to do work. I done cement work, I done construction work, I worked as a part-time meat cutter. I stocked shelves for a while in a store. I had to do whatever I could do to keep bills paid, and so it was very stressful.\u201d Michigan\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been in power since 2018, presiding over one of the strictest lockdowns in the country \u2014 in a state Trump won in 2016, Biden took in 2020, and Obama won twice. Now, Whitmer could very well lose her seat to GOP-backed Tudor Dixon, who trails her opponent by less than one percentage point . A registered Republican, Herberling said he will be voting for Dixon for governor \u2014 who visited his shop recently \u2014 and not just because her running mate, state Rep. Shane Hernandez, is one of his faithful clients. \u201cI have never voted a straight ticket in my life,\u201d Herberling said. \u201cI supported Democrat John Espinoza, our state representative, all three times he ran and won office. I tend to vote for the people that support my beliefs.\u201d Today\u2019s economic pressures, especially on the beef farm, are informing his vote this year. \u201cInflation is killing us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost of production to raise an acre of corn this year went up probably 50- to 60%, next year it\u2019ll probably double from what it was two years ago. The cost of machinery is astronomical. I mean, a 40-year-old tractor that you could have bought for $10,000 a year ago is now $15,000. \u201cThe fuel cost is the biggest thing. I mean, you go from $1.79 diesel fuel to $5.40 diesel fuel. Them tractors eat five, six gallons an hour, some of them. The honest-to-goodness truth is there really is no money at the end of the day. In fact, there\u2019s less because of everything going up.\u201d Doug Wood, his wife, Chelsea, and their three kids are new to Dayton, Ohio. Until 2020, Doug, 38, was happily settled in Peters Township, Penn., near Pittsburgh, where he lived close to family and enjoyed his career as director of transportation and development at 84 Lumber. But last fall, 84 Lumber\u2019s embrace of the COVID vaccine mandate changed everything for him. \u201cI chose not to get it, so I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat upset me about how my company in particular went about it, was that it wasn\u2019t every position in the company. I became frustrated with the company because they were picking and choosing where to apply the mandate and my choice was over the principle of the thing.\u201d Wood found a new position in the transportation industry in Dayton, and his wife Chelsea, 36, is now expecting their fourth child. Montgomery County, where they live, is the ultimate swing county. Obama won by large margins here in 2008 and 2012. But in 2016, Trump beat Clinton, marking the first time since 1988 that voters in this county went Republican. Four years later, they picked Biden over Trump. This year, Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan is running against Republican J.D. Vance for US Senate in Ohio. For months, the two candidates were neck-and-neck, but a recent poll from USA Today/Suffolk University shows Vance pulling away by 2 points. In any other year, Wood said he would give Ryan a second look over Vance, the author of 2016\u2019s bestselling memoir \u201c Hillbilly Elegy \u201d who was endorsed by Trump. But not this year. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty Democrats have placed in every aspect of our lives and the overreach that has me voting for Vance. Heck, I am voting all Republican,\u201d said Wood, who added that voting for one party down ballot is something he rarely does. \u201cThe way the inflation\u2019s gone, [it\u2019s] just a complete lapse of judgment on the impact government spending would have on the country,\u201d he added. Public education policies also concern him. \u201cFor instance, we moved to a certain school district, and are paying higher taxes to get a quality public school education for our kids,\u201d he said. Now he and his wife are second-guessing that decision. \u201cIt seems to be fine now, but you just worry with the public school sector. Did we make the right choice? Should we send our kids to Catholic school or find a private school? I would not hesitate to pull my kids and reassess their education if I find their education is not math and science and instead becoming part of the woke culture.\u201d He shakes his head at the state of the country. \u201cI\u2019ve voted for Barack Obama, I\u2019ve voted for Donald Trump.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Like many Arizonans, I grew up in a family with some divided political allegiances. My parents were registered Republicans , but politics was something we kept to ourselves. And like millions of Americans, we dutifully voted each election, but around the dinner table, politics was far from the conversation -- and most of the voters I talk to on the campaign trail today would welcome a return to that. In this way, my family reflected the reality of millions of Americans -- homes where we may have privately disagreed about politics, but never about our shared values. In my family, and in our country, far more united us than divided us. That reality seems hard to imagine right now. A SIMPLE GUIDE TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS, HOW THEY AFFECT THE PRESIDENCY, AND MORE I was born and grew up here in Arizona , a state that mirrored that independent, bipartisan spirit, with a long history of leaders that put country before their political party. Icons like John McCain , the maverick of the Senate. Or Janet Napolitano, who worked with a divided legislature to reform our state's education system while balancing the budget. But in today\u2019s polarized environment, those on the extremes have turned \"bipartisanship\" into a dirty word.

It\u2019s been replaced by MAGA, which puts allegiance to the former president over anything else: policy, values, or our country. FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: DEMS, GOP LOCKED IN CLOSE BATTLE AS FINAL MONTH OF CAMPAIGNING BEGINS It\u2019s true across the country, and it\u2019s true here in Arizona. The party of Barry Goldwater and John McCain is gone. The new GOP is led by extremist, radical stone throwers like Kari Lake who disparage great Americans like McCain, and are more interested in garnering headlines and booking cable news hits than actually delivering on the issues facing Arizonans.

And instead of delivering a policy agenda that will solve the massive issues facing our state: rampant inflation , a housing crisis, or the water shortage, they\u2019re looking to support their attention-seeking behavior by going viral on social media. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In lieu of solutions to those pressing problems, Kari Lake has promised: to risk millions of dollars by threatening the Super Bowl in Arizona , would like to undo the 2020 election and put government cameras in our classrooms to spy on children. She has even threatened to arrest some FBI and DOJ agents if they come to Arizona. And those \"plans\" on her website? Experts say her economic plan would add \u2018jet fuel\u2019 to inflation, exacerbating an affordability crisis for our state when millions of Arizonans need relief.

This isn\u2019t a small disagreement between Democratic or Republican ideas. This is about a simple choice -- between sanity and chaos, and whether we want to continue to live in a democracy where our Constitution and country come first.

But this being a Hallmark Movies and Mysteries presentation, you know it\u2019s gonna deliver the drama too. Is A Maple Valley Christmas too sappy for our tastes, or does this family drama have the right amount of sweetness? The Gist: Peyton List stars as Erica, the latest in a long line of syrup ranchers (which is not what they\u2019re called, but absolutely what they should be called). She runs the Holden family ranch with her mother Ina (Frances Flanagan) and sister Heidi (Ella Cannon) \u2014 but there\u2019s a change blowin\u2019 in the wind. Not only is the ranch next door offering to sell back the land they bought from the Holdens decades ago, but Mama Holden\u2019s moving out of the country to be with her Italian boyfriend (Francisco Trujillo)! At least Erica can buy back the land and make her family\u2019s ranch whole for the first time in generations \u2014 well, she could if real estate developers weren\u2019t stock villains in Hallmark movies. Instead, the cutthroat Steve Davenport (Paul Jarrett) wants that ranch and he sends his hot son Aaron (Andrew Walker) to Montana to scope out the land. Making matters even worse for Erica: her sister Heidi doesn\u2019t want the land back! Can\u2019t a beautiful syrup rancher catch a break? Erica: you\u2019re gonna catch a break, and his name is \u201cAndrew.\u201d He\u2019s hunky, knows how to ride a horse, and just may be willing to cut ties with his dad for you. The big question is, will he? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Y\u2019know those \u201990s romantic dramas that were always set at a ranch, or at least had a horse on the VHS cover? It\u2019s giving me that, but Hallmark. Performance Worth Watching: The whole cast is solid, but I enjoyed Paul Jarrett\u2019s turn as Aaron\u2019s emotionally unavailable father Steve. You know he\u2019s up to no good because he has a goatee. That\u2019s the facial hair of evil twins! Memorable Dialogue: At the end of one of the ranch\u2019s maple tree tours, Erica gives them all a piece of advice: \u201cWhen I\u2019m feeling sappy, I like to remind myself that patience and hard work beget sweetness\u201d To be fair, Erica warns the tourists that the advice is full of bad puns. A Holiday Tradition: The maple farm hosts an annual tree lighting event, offers photos with Santa Claus and gives Christmas-themed horseback ride (complete with an Elf reference). They also sell maple-flavored everything a the Maple Christmas Fair every year. And there\u2019s also the \u201cprime rib sleigh ride dinner,\u201d which either follows or precedes the Maple Valley Christmas sleigh ride. Probably better to eat prime rib after dashing through the snow? Two Turtle Doves: This is the first of two Hallmark movies starring Andrew Walker this season. The next one is Three Wise Men and a Baby (Nov. 19), which teams Walker up with two of Hallmark\u2019s other leading men: Tyler Hynes and Paul Campbell. And there\u2019s also Sappy Holiday on UPtv (Dec. 17), which is another movie about a family\u2019s maple farm. Does the Title Make Any Sense?: It does, and I have the urge to give them extra credit for not working \u201csappy\u201d into the movie title. Our Take: Maybe this is a sign that I know too much about the Hallmark brand, but I\u2019m always a tiny bit more excited to watch a Movies & Mysteries holiday movie. That\u2019s because while regular Hallmark\u2019s holiday movies follow a formula, the M&M ones can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 go to unexpected places (see: Holly & Ivy and One December Night ). And now that even Hallmark Hallmark\u2019s movies are starting to veer off the beaten path (a movie with three leading men? What in the world is Three Wise Men and a Baby going to be like?!), Movies & Mysteries can truly pop off. I write all that to say \u2014 A Maple Valley Christmas doesn\u2019t go as hard as M&M movies can go. That\u2019s not a dig! I just felt the need to explain the difference between Hallmark and Hallmark Xtra. That\u2019s not to say that A Maple Valley Christmas doesn\u2019t take the Hallmark feels into new territory. It absolutely does, from the complicated family dynamics (the Holden sisters have some issues to sort through) to all of the conflicting motivations to sell/buy/pass on the property that\u2019s opening up over yonder. A Maple Valley Christmas does offer something new in its cinematography, though. The film opens up in the middle of the forest, with snow-covered trees all with a bucket affixed to them. It\u2019s a surprisingly striking sight, and a sign of visuals to come. Like, the first time Erica sees Aaron, he\u2019s emerging from the woods on horseback like a damn Disney prince. And throughout, the film has a silvery, midnight blue undertone to it that just makes the whole thing feel a little\u2026 fancier. It\u2019s looks a little more elevated than what we\u2019re used to seeing. While the plot may drag a little bit in the last act, the performances are always spot-on. Would you expect anything less from Andrew Walker, Hallmark\u2019s most reliable mainstay? And good job Hallmark for getting Peyton List on the team. She\u2019s such a natural in this genre, and she brings a lot of dramatic weight to the role. Here\u2019s hoping she comes back \u2019round these parts every holiday season. Our Call: STREAM IT .

The latest evidence was Miami\u2019s trade-deadline acquisition of edge rusher Bradley Chubb from Denver on Tuesday. That served as a bookend of sorts to the marquee offseason acquisition of dynamic receiver Tyreek Hill. The Dolphins, who are 5-3 entering their game Sunday at Chicago, smell opportunity, and why not? They have reached the playoffs just twice in the past 20 years and haven\u2019t been to the postseason since 2016. Miami\u2019s last playoff win came in 2000. The team has won its division just twice in the past 22 years. The last time the Dolphins reached the AFC title game was in 1992, and their last Super Bowl appearance was in 1984. Adding to the potential romance of this story is the fact this year is the 50th anniversary of the Dolphins\u2019 fabled 17-0 season of 1972. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to talk about going to a playoff game, having an opportunity to go to one and then hopefully winning one,\u2019\u2019 quarterback Tua Tagovailoa told reporters this week. \u201cI think throughout OTAs and throughout training camp, we could see the potential that we had as a team offensively and defensively, and we\u2019re not afraid to talk about Super Bowls here.\u2019\u2019 There was good reason for the Dolphins to make those moves \u2014 particularly since it looks as if they have their franchise quarterback in place with Tagovailoa, who has taken significant strides in his third NFL season. Remember when Hill was brought in from the Chiefs and he told reporters that Tagovailoa was a more accurate passer than the Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes? That comment was ridiculed by many who believed Hill was taking a shot at his former quarterback. But Hill was speaking the truth. Tagovailoa is completing 69.9 percent of his passes for 1,678 yards (279.7 per game) and has 12 touchdown passes with just three interceptions this season. Mahomes is at 66.9 percent. And it\u2019s not as if Tagovailoa is dinking and dunking. He leads the league in yards per pass attempt (9.0), quarterback rating (112.7) and QBR (78.7). Tagovailoa, who missed two games with a concussion (both Miami losses) is 5-1 as a starter this season and 18-9 in his career, including 11-2 in his past 13 starts. Hill already has 69 receptions for 961 yards and two TDs through eight games, numbers that project to 147 receptions for 2,042 yards in a 17-game season. Jaylen Waddle, the receiver opposite Hill, has 42 receptions for 727 yards and five TDs. When news of the deal for Chubb broke, Hill tweeted: \u201cAm I reading this right?\u201d \u201cWelcome to Miami, Mr. Chubb,\u201d Hill added. \u201cI know the young talent they have over there,\u201d Chubb told reporters after the trade was consummated. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be part of it. I just want to add whatever I can add to the group.\u201d Chubb figures to add in a big way to a Dolphins defense that is among the five worst in the league in yards per play allowed, pressuring the quarterback and forcing turnovers. All of those numbers are expected to improve. And with those numbers increasing, so too will the wins likely increase. Is contending for a Super Bowl out of the question? \u201cI would say I have full belief that we are capable,\u2019\u2019 Tagovailoa said.", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-23.2565860748291, -10.640936851501465]}, {"title": "Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code NPBONUSFULL: Jump on huge college football bonus", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/caesars-sportsbook-promo-code-npbonusfull-grab-1250-on-caesars-for-college-football/", "description": "Get your hands on a huge sports bonus with the Caesars Sportsbook Promo code NPBONUSFULL before USC vs. Cal tonight.", "content": "New York Post readers can take advantage of a massive new customer offer with the Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code NPBONUSFULL .

Navy bumped its record to 3-5 with an overtime win over Temple last week, but the Midshipmen were dealt a significant blow when they lost starting quarterback Tai Lavatai to a season-ending injury. The silver lining here is that the drop-off from Lavatai to Xavier Arline shouldn\u2019t be too dramatic given Navy\u2019s triple-option offensive scheme. There is no secret to Navy\u2019s offensive game plan. The Midshipmen want to trudge down the field via the triple-option. Navy has the third-highest rush rate in the country and ranks 104th in seconds per play. This is a slow, methodical offense. On paper, Cincinnati\u2019s defense should match up well with Navy. The Bearcats rank 15th in yards per rush allowed, 22nd in rushing success rate and 35th in defensive line yards. Cincinnati is the 22nd-best tackling defense in the country, per Pro Football Focus. While you can give Cincinnati\u2019s defense the edge as the best unit in the matchup, the Navy defense deserves plenty of respect, too. The Midshipmen rank 23rd in rushing success rate, third in defensive line yards and boast the 15th-best havoc rating. The Midshipmen may struggle stopping the pass, but Cincinnati\u2019s aerial attack ranks 59th in success rate and the Bearcats are 79th in the country at finishing drives. The numbers already make Navy look like an enticing underdog at this price, but what\u2019s most appealing is the stylistic matchup. It is always a good idea to consider a bet on service academies when they\u2019re catching more than two touchdowns. Since Navy runs a triple-option and runs the ball more than almost any other team in the country, you know the clock will be moving. That will limit possessions and shorten the game, which is always a good thing for underdogs catching points. The numbers back up that theory: Since 2005, the three service academies have gone 43-26-1 (61.4 percent) as underdogs of at least 14 points (per Action Network). And one more feather in Navy\u2019s cap as an ugly underdog is the total. The Over/Under is set at 44 points currently and the Under has already taken money to get it there, so the market is telling us that this could be a rock fight, which, once again, should suit the Midshipmen.", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-27.37139129638672, -4.5814361572265625]}, {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel tweets endorsement video of Nevada Senate Democrat over \u2018creep\u2019 Republican Adam Laxalt", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/jimmy-kimmel-releases-endorsement-nevada-senate-democrat-over-creep-republican-adam-laxalt", "description": "The \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" host tweeted video of himself endorsing Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, calling her the \"sane\" choice.", "content": "close Video Montage: Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s history of partisan rhetoric, heated remarks against Republicans The once apolitical late-night host interviewing President Biden this week has not been shy about ripping into Republicans in recent years.

And with four out of five of us identifying as queer, it\u2019s not that much of an exaggeration,\u201d Hempel, now 47, tells The Post. She explores this dynamic in her memoir, \u201cThe Family Outing\u201d (HarperOne). Hempel, who came out as gay in college and is now married with two toddlers, learned of her dad\u2019s bisexuality when her dad was in his 50s and she was in her early 20s; her younger sister Katje found emails between her dad and other men. For several years, Hempel\u2019s mother and dad tried being separated but living under one roof, until they finally divorced. Hempel\u2019s brother and sister also came out during college, with everyone in the family coming out within a five-year-span. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool thing to have my brother and sister share my queer identity,\u201d says Hempel. \u201cBut one thing I think that is really important to point out is how different queer identity can be for different people.

Then you get my brother who did not identify with my version of being queer at all, and for whom gender was really up for reconsideration at the same time. Then you get my dad and he comes steaming out of the closet with his rainbow towels and his rainbow candles and his rainbow ring.\u201d But a shared identity also led to strained relationships. \u201cMy dad couldn\u2019t understand at first why we [his adult children] weren\u2019t like, \u2018Welcome to the club, we\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here.\u2019 It took him a while to realize he actually needed to still build relationships with his children,\u201d says Hempel. Growing up, Hempel often felt alone. Her mother was depressed and often verbally lashed out in anger. Her father was emotionally absent. Even as the family began sharing secrets, there were still distances in her family. Sometimes, one member of the family wouldn\u2019t reach out for months at a time. And yet, throughout the decades, no one ever estranged or permanently alienated themselves. \u201cAt the end of the day, we needed each other,\u201d explains Hempel. \u201cWe needed things from each other. We needed a bed to stay on or money to borrow or the things that the families in their best moments can provide for each other, even if their feelings about each other are complex. So that ended up keeping us tied together in gentle ways.\u201d In 2016, Hempel had the opportunity to interview her brother about his process toward becoming pregnant as a trans man for a profile in Time magazine. The result brought the pair closer together. Six years apart in age, Hempel and her brother, Evan, were close, but Hempel found she was surprised about how much more she learned about him when approaching his experiences as a journalist. And as the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine hit, she thought about applying that perspective to dig deeper into the individual stories of each of her family members. The ask was charged, and Hempel\u2019s sister, in particular, had qualms. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking to just tell my story. I was asking to tell her story as I interpreted it, and that is a huge ask,\u201d Hempel recalls. And while the memoir is anchored in queer identity, Hempel says that the story arc can be seen as universal. \u201cI take a broad view of coming out. Our parents think they know who they want us to be, our communities do, our religious communities do. Then we begin to grow in our lives and our bodies. And inevitably, there is a distance between what the world wants from us and who we know ourselves to be.\u201d Now, as a parent herself \u2014 her son is 4 and her daughter is 1 \u2014 Hempel feels like the project not only has made her closer to her own family of origin, but it\u2019s made her a stronger parent. \u201cI\u2019d love for this book to be the assurance that it is a beautiful thing to pursue the most authentic version of yourself,\u201d Hempel says. \u201cAt the same time, I hope that the book is an invitation for you to make room for the people closest to you to do the same.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-0.2745462954044342, 1.1795220375061035]}, {"title": "LeBron James says Kyrie Irving 'caused some harm to a lot of people'", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/sport/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-spt-intl-scli/index.html", "description": "Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James says former teammate Kyrie Irving \"caused some harm to a lot of people.\"", "content": "Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James says former teammate Kyrie Irving \u201ccaused some harm to a lot of people.\u201d Irving missed the first of several Brooklyn Nets games Friday after he was suspended for comments regarding his tweet linking to an antisemitic documentary. Speaking to reporters at a post-game press conference after the Lakers lost to the Utah Jazz on Friday, James said: \u201cI believe what Kyrie did caused some harm to a lot of people. He has since, over the last \u2013 today, or was it yesterday \u2013 he apologized. But he caused some harm. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what color your skin is, how tall you are, what position you\u2019re in \u2013 if you are promoting or soliciting, or saying harmful things to any community that harm people, then I don\u2019t respect it. I don\u2019t condone it.\u201d The Nets suspended Irving Thursday after he initially doubled down on his decision to share the content on his Twitter account. The star point guard issued an apology hours later on his verified Instagram account, in which he said he took full accountability for his action. \u201cTo All Jewish families and Communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize,\u201d Irving wrote. \u201cI initially reacted out of emotion to being unjustly labeled Anti-Semitic, instead of focusing on the healing process of my Jewish Brothers and Sisters that were hurt from the hateful remarks made in the Documentary. Kyrie Irving apologizes amid Twitter controversy and suspension by Brooklyn Nets over 'failure to disavow antisemitism' \u201cI had no intentions to disrespect any Jewish cultural history regarding the Holocaust or perpetuate any hate. I am learning from this unfortunate event and hope we can find understanding between us all,\u201d Irving continued. On Friday, criticism of Irving continued to mount with Nike suspending its relationship with the NBA star. \u201cAt Nike, we believe there is no place for hate speech and we condemn any form of antisemitism,\u201d Nike said in a statement to CNN. \u201cTo that end, we\u2019ve made the decision to suspend our relationship with Kyrie Irving effective immediately and will no longer launch the Kyrie 8. We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the situation and its impact on everyone.\u201d The company\u2019s move comes after Irving defended his decision to share a link to the 2018 film \u201cHebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America\u201d last week. The movie, based on Ronald Dalton\u2019s book of the same name, has been blasted by civil rights groups for its antisemitism. Reporters asked Irving earlier Thursday \u2013 before he posted his apology \u2013 if he holds antisemitic beliefs or if he was sorry. At the time, he replied saying he respects \u201call walks of life\u201d and that he didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm. The Nets later said they were \u201cdismayed\u201d when the player \u201crefused to unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs, nor acknowledge specific hateful material in the film,\u201d during a media session. \u201cSuch failure to disavow antisemitism when given a clear opportunity to do so is deeply disturbing, is against the values of our organization, and constitutes conduct detrimental to the team,\u201d the Nets said in their statement before Irving apologized. The team also said they made repeated attempts to help Irving \u201cunderstand the harm and danger of his words and actions.\u201d Irving\u2019s suspension without pay meant he did not play in Friday\u2019s game against the Washington Wizards. The suspension will last for at least four additional games, and Irving is also required to satisfy \u201ca series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct,\u201d the Nets said. When asked Friday if there was any consideration of releasing Irving, Nets general manager Sean Marks replied, \u201cNo. Not at this particular time.\u201d \u201cThere is going to be some remedial steps and measures that have been put in place for him to obviously seek some counseling \u2026 from dealing with some anti-hate and some Jewish leaders within our community,\u201d Marks said while speaking to reporters before the Nets-Wizards game. Nike suspends relationship with Kyrie Irving \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to sit down with them, he\u2019s going to have to sit down with the organization after this, and we\u2019ll evaluate and see if this is the right opportunity to bring him back,\u201d Marks added. Irving\u2019s Nets teammate Kevin Durant described this week\u2019s matters as \u201cunnecessary\u201d and expressed his belief that the team could have \u201ckept quiet\u201d about Irving\u2019s comments. \u201cI ain\u2019t here to judge nobody or talk down on nobody \u2026 I just didn\u2019t like anything that went on. I feel like it was all unnecessary,\u201d Durant said about Irving\u2019s team-issued suspension during the Nets\u2019 pre-game availability on Friday. \u201cI feel like we could have just kept playing basketball and kept quiet as an organization. I just don\u2019t like none of it.\u201d Asked whether he thought the suspension was unfair, Durant said, \u201cI believe and trust in the organization to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Shortly after his media availability, Durant tweeted , \u201cJust wanna clarify the statements I made at shootaround, I see some people are confused..I don\u2019t condone hate speech or anti-semitism, I\u2019m about spreading love always.\u201d \u201cOur game Unites people and I wanna make sure that\u2019s at the forefront,\u201d he added. Irving\u2019s remarks during the media session with reporters Thursday have escalated the controversy. When asked if he was apologizing, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm. I\u2019m not the one that made the documentary.\u201d Asked if he was surprised by the reaction, Irving said, \u201cI take my full responsibility, again I\u2019ll repeat it, for posting something on my Instagram or Twitter that may have had some unfortunate falsehoods in it,\u201d Irving replied. Asked if he had any antisemitic beliefs, Irving responded: \u201cI respect all walks of life. I embrace all walks of life. That\u2019s where I sit.\u201d Pressed further to answer yes or no to a question on whether Irving had any antisemitic beliefs, he replied: \u201cI cannot be antisemitic if I know where I come from.\u201d Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving defends his tweet about a documentary criticized as antisemitic and stands by sharing a video by Alex Jones When Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, learned of how the NBA star answered that question, he pointed out that Irving has \u201ca lot of work to do.\u201d \u201cThe answer to the question \u2018Do you have any antisemitic beliefs\u2019 is always \u2018NO\u2019 without equivocation. We took @KyrieIrving at his word when he said he took responsibility, but today he did not make good on that promise,\u201d Greenblatt wrote. After Irving was suspended Thursday, the ADL refused to accept a $500,000 donation that Irving and the Nets had previously announced. The ADL\u2019s decision to decline the donation was before Irving apologized late Thursday. The star\u2019s comments also garnered reproach from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Irving. \u201cKyrie Irving made a reckless decision to post a link to a film containing deeply offensive antisemitic material,\u201d Silver said in a statement before Irving apologized. The controversy comes as antisemitism has been on the rise in the US over the past few years. At least 2,717 antisemitic incidents were reported in the US in 2021, an increase from 942 such incidents in 2015, according to the ADL . Irving has run into controversy in recent years that has affected his playing time. Last season, Irving did not play in many of Brooklyn\u2019s home games because he was not vaccinated against Covid-19, which was a hindrance to playing in indoor arenas due to a New York City workplace vaccine mandate. The rule was later lifted and he returned to Barclays Center in March.", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "cnn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-12.230979919433594, -6.73522424697876]}, {"title": "How the NYC Marathon saved one Beatriz Fritschler\u2019s life after 2 aneurysms", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/beatriz-fritschler-running-nyc-marathon-after-2-aneurysms/", "description": "Two aneurysms and a pre-diabetes diagnosis finally convinced Beatriz Fritschler to get healthy.", "content": "Four years ago, Beatriz Fritschler was fighting for her life \u2014 but this Sunday she will fight to finish her first New York City Marathon . Having gone from intensive care at New York-Presbyterian Columbia Hospital , where she was given a 50 percent chance of survival, to the starting line at Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island, the 46-year-old has already completed a journey that matches the marathon itself for intensity and inspiration. Fritschler\u2019s road to running began unexpectedly. One night in March 2018, the administrator for a social services organization was in bed at her home in Washington Heights. \u201cSuddenly, I had the worst headache of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband was in the living room and I had a hard time walking out to him. I was slurring words, and he asked if I\u2019d been drinking.\u201d Next morning, the pain escalated, so she went to the ER. A day after that, Fritschler, said, \u201csurgeons opened my skull. An aneurysm had burst.\u201d The operation was a success and the rupture was clipped, but things suddenly got even more scary while Fristschler was recovering in the hospital \u201cThey did a scan and saw a second aneurysm, which had not yet ruptured. It was bigger than the first,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI freaked out and was afraid to sneeze.\u201d On her 19 th day in the hospital, Fritschler had a second brain surgery, which was also successful. But the experience was a wake-up call. \u201cI was the only person in the neurological ICU who could walk and talk,\u201d she said, recalling that the person in the bed next to hers died while they were both hospitalized. \u201cI was 50 pounds overweight and had high blood pressure. I wondered why I was so lucky to be cognitively and physically intact.\u201d Back at home, Fritschler said, \u201cI thanked God and apologized to my body for not treating it well. I committed to moving 30 minutes per day and to eating healthy, but I was not trying to lose weight. Then, one year later, in 2019, I found out I was pre-diabetic. I realized that radical body-size acceptance was not working.\u201d She joined Weight Watchers and started going to the gym \u2014 which closed months later when COVID hit. \u201cIn April 2021, I found women working out in Fort Tryon Park and decided to join them,\u201d said Fritschler. There was just one problem: \u201cPart of the warm-up was jogging for two or three minutes. As a kid, I would run half-a-block and get pain in my stomach. It was hard to do those two or three minutes.\u201d Within weeks, though, it got easier. Then Fritschler did what once seemed impossible. \u201cI ran one mile. Afterward, I cried. I had never done it before and thought I never would.\u201d Bit by the running bug, she joined New York Road Runners \u2018 eight-week-long beginners program. \u201cBy the end of the eight weeks, I was able to run for 30 minutes nonstop,\u201d Fritschler said. \u201cThen I advanced to speed training, which had me doing sprints to improve my cardiovascular endurance and make me run faster. I joined Creative Living Runners Club and ran my first half-marathon last year. I\u2019ve since done more than 12 races, which qualified me for the 2023 New York City Marathon.\u201d Fritschler \u2014 who has lost 55 pounds on her journey \u2014 was happy enough with that situation, but the unimaginable happened. \u201cCommunity running clubs get a number of entries that get distributed to the most devoted runners,\u201d said Fritschler. \u201cI received one, which qualifies me for this year\u2019s marathon. I felt amazing. It validates all the hard work I put in.\u201d Sunday morning, Fritschler will blast off from the starting line at 11:30. Friends and family will be cheering her on along the way. \u201cI am in love with running and with experiencing the runner\u2019s high,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cBut I\u2019ll feel high even before I start running on Sunday.

Her story, including a remarkable recovery, turned into the 2012 best-selling memoir \u201cBrain on Fire\u201d and later a movie of the same name. It has also helped save many lives. Here, Cahalan shares an excerpted update from the 10th-anniversary edition of the book , out later this month. I stared at the unwrapped gift, struggling to recognize what I was holding. It looked like lumpy mashed potatoes. \u201cIt\u2019s a candle,\u201d my brother, James, said. A candle? But this had no botanical scent or wick, no obvious way to hold a flame. I examined the yellow, fillet-sized mass in my hands until the object came into focus: it was an anatomically correct brain with wrinkly grooves and two identical hemispheres. James bought it during a trip to Lisbon at one of the oldest candle shops in the world. He asked the two women who worked there about the shop\u2019s strange organ candles\u2014a femur bone, a lung, even a kidney. James couldn\u2019t understand it all, but he came away with instructions: They were meant to represent the overcoming of a trial. The key was to burn them when the person was ready to move on. It took him a beat to think of someone who would beneft from such a candle. \u201cDo you have a brain?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, yes! We only have one left.\u201d Months later in my apartment in Brooklyn, holding that brain in my hands, I was touched by the sentiment but also, despite myself, wounded by it. I had done everything possible to prove my mastery over that broken brain: I had written a book, spoken endlessly in lecture halls and medical school auditoriums, and sat through the surreal experience of watching my book adapted into a movie. What would it take to prove that I had overcome? I put the brain candle on my bookcase and made a mental note to burn it as soon as I got the chance. That was two years ago. The brain sat in my living room until I moved to a new house, where it sits on a writing desk in my cluttered office. Looking at it now, I think of the Epicurus quote: \u201cAgainst other things it is possible to obtain security, but when it comes to death we human beings all live in an unwalled city.\u201d I have not been brave enough to throw my brain into the fire. I\u2019m writing this 13 years after my diagnosis with autoimmune encephalitis, a decade after the publication of my book \u201cBrain on Fire,\u201d and five years after my husband, Stephen, and I exchanged our vows (which, to Stephen\u2019s absolute befuddlement, is the answer to the second-most Googled question about the book). I\u2019m now on the border of middle age. I have three-year-old twins who leave me delirious with joy, exasperation and sleep deprivation. And I cling to the hope that life will never be as chaotic as it was when I wrote this book. There have been changes since I wrote this book. Positive ones. I don\u2019t talk in my sleep anymore and I\u2019ve stopped smacking my lips when I eat, a symptom that followed me for years. I still struggle to find the right words, but I try not to attribute these lapses to my brain illness, and instead to my inherent shortcomings. I still have a bald spot from the brain biopsy, and sometimes I reach up to check and make sure it\u2019s not visible. According to a blood test done years ago, my body still houses the brain-targeting autoantibodies that made me sick. My physician, Dr. Souhel Najjar, isn\u2019t alarmed, mostly intrigued. I am off medication and have not had a relapse, but I\u2019ve had a few run-ins with what Virginia Woolf called \u201cthe undiscovered countries\u201d of illness \u2014 a diagnosis of melanoma, a stomach- churning (and rare) allergy to chia seeds, and a terrifying bout with vertigo that rattled my confidence for months. I still fear the words \u201cinteresting patient.\u201d In the hospital after my twins were born, I surprised the staff by showing signs of preeclampsia after birth. The pain in my abdomen was so intense that it felt like being stabbed by an invisible knife. But the staff dismissed my intense suffering. One doctor asked me with clear condescension, \u201cIs this your first time having surgery?\u201d (I nearly spat back: I\u2019ve had several surgeries, including a brain biopsy.) A nurse thought she was helping to rally me to the bathroom when she said, \u201cDo it for your babies!\u201d It took two days of projectile-vomiting bile before another nurse was able to convince the attending physician to do an X-ray on my stomach. When she did, there was evidence of ileus, or a blockage in my intestines. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one of these in decades!\u201d said one of the doctors. Please, don\u2019t ever let me be interesting again. Luckily, in the past 10 years, I\u2019ve lost my interesting status and have become a \u201cclassic case.\u201d Had I presented with the same symptoms last year, I\u2019m certain that my diagnosis would have come far faster than it did in 2009. Recognition is vastly improved. Diagnosis is happening at the earliest stages \u2014 in emergency room settings and even in the offices of family doctors. To give you some perspective on the change at the research level: If I had been capable of searching on PubMed using the terms \u201cautoimmune encephalitis\u201d when I was sick, I would have found 84 papers ever written; now there are more than 2,000 papers on this subject. Textbooks dedicate chapters to it. Medical students learn it before they even start treating patients. All of this advancement is key: a faster diagnosis often equates to a more robust recovery. The past decade has also seen a dramatic rise in the community surrounding autoimmune encephalitis. Nonprofts, family organizations, and Facebook groups dedicated to helping spread the word and connecting people with care \u2014 which didn\u2019t exist when I was sick \u2014 are now a Google search away. Two of my personal favorites are the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance and the Encephalitis Society. I recommend reaching out to both if you suspect you or a loved one has autoimmune encephalitis. There are also far more concrete numbers about the prevalence: There\u2019s about a one in a million shot at getting anti-NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. (The incidence rate jumps to 1 in 100,000 when you account for the 20-plus newly discovered kinds of autoimmune encephalitis.) This sounds rare \u2014 you\u2019re more likely to be struck by lightning \u2014 but there\u2019s a small city full of the diagnosed who didn\u2019t exist when I was one of only 217 people. Now there are tens of thousands, if not more of us, all over the world. The portrait of a typical patient has remained consistent \u2014 a woman in her early twenties (though recent studies are showing that older people are likely being under-diagnosed). The disease is still more prevalent in women, which is true of autoimmune diseases in general, highlighting questions about the complexity of female immune systems, misdiagnosis of chronic versus acute conditions and the marginalization of women\u2019s pain. There is still no FDA-approved drug for autoimmune encephalitis, which means that all treatment is still \u201coff label,\u201d a serious issue that several doctors are trying to remedy in clinical trials. Still, about 75 % of us will recover to \u201cfunctional independence,\u201d with what is perceived as a \u201cgood recovery.\u201d But what does \u201cgood\u201d mean, anyway? These are some of the questions I\u2019ve received from people during their recoveries: Will I ever be able to concentrate again? When will I be well enough to return to school? Will I ever not be tired? Will my girlfriend still love me? Will I be able to have children? Will I ever be \u2018me\u2019 again? Though doctors are far more comprehensive in follow-up than they were when I was diagnosed (no one ever asked me how I was doing emotionally, or suggested that I see a therapist), the goal of \u201cfunctional independence\u201d still seems shallow and incomplete. \u201cOutcomes are \u2018good,\u2019 but not good enough,\u201d Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. Gregg Day told me. He wants to help his patients return to what they consider to be good outcomes, not just what objective tests of mobility or cognitive functioning show. He had this breakthrough when meeting with a patient who broke down after he asked, \u201cHow are you?\u201d Through her tears she confided that earlier that day she received a concerned call from her son\u2019s school about his lunch, which consisted of two slices of bread with nothing inside. She felt humiliated by this lapse because it revealed how far she still was from a true return to herself pre-illness. This only came up because Dr. Day had asked that simple but illuminating question: How are you? A few months ago, I received a desperate email from a family whose adult daughter disappeared after a psychotic break that they believed might have been immune related. They were hamstrung as she refused care and left her home to live on the streets. They finally convinced her to go to the hospital, where emergency room doctors treated her for autoimmune encephalitis, but because of the length of time she went untreated, it is unclear if she will ever achieve a so-called good recovery. I am deluged with the outpouring of emails from others who are dealing with dismissive doctors, or greedy insurance companies refusing coverage, or symptoms that are so diffuse that it takes months, if not years, to receive an accurate diagnosis. The terrible reality is that our medical care system continues to fail vast numbers of people who need help. These are the stories that I can\u2019t get out of my head. I take some comfort in the fact that my book has helped many people. I can say with certainty that my story has even saved lives. (Writing that sentence will never stop astounding me.) It\u2019s impossible to know how wide my story\u2019s reach has been, but I can say that hundreds of people have contacted me with stories of how my book helped them find a diagnosis . A doctor friend told me that her hospital tests anyone coming in with signs of a first psychiatric break for \u201cbrain on fire.\u201d At least a dozen nurses have told me that they have made an autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis after reading my book. Medical students have shared personal stories of pursuing careers in neurology or psychiatry after reading my story. Parents take my book to doctor appointments and physicians recommend that people in the midst of recovery read it for solace and inspiration. One mother told me that it helped her better understand the experience of her nonverbal son. A high school student told me that it gave her the support necessary to seek out help with her suicidal thoughts. I\u2019ve received emails from all over the world\u2014from India and Germany, Syria and Brazil. One of the highlights of my life was sitting in a room full of Japanese families after the movie premiere there, each telling me the ways that the book helped them find a diagnosis or a route along the long, unsettled road of recovery. I don\u2019t think I can express what this has meant to me. I\u2019m proud to say that my story doesn\u2019t belong to me anymore. It belongs to you. But if that brain candle is any indication, I\u2019m still having a hard time letting go of the past. I called my brother to talk about the candle and, as we spoke, James realized then that he had gotten it a bit wrong in the initial retelling. These organ candles were not meant as a symbol of moving on, something to destroy so that you could blaze forward and leave the past behind. These were objects of acknowledgment. The candle was meant to be laid out as an offering, as an acknowledgment of grace, as an act of awe and love. They weren\u2019t lit to erase the pain, but to honor it.

That, in turn, led the Border Patrol to initiate crowd-control measures. \"These measures included the use of the authorized less-lethal force pepperball launching system,\" the statement said. \"The crowd then dispersed and returned to Mexico.\" CBP said its Office of Professional Responsibility was reviewing the incident. However, the incident drew immediate condemnation from activist groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which called the incident \"the latest in a long line of abuses carried out by CBP.\" \"Our government's failed attempts at preventing people from seeking protection in the U.S. lead to death and suffering. The Biden administration must restore a humane process for seeking asylum,\" the group said. That caused consternation from the National Border Patrol Council, which told the group: \"Go to hell.\" On Tuesday, hours after CBP released its initial statement, Magnus issued a separate statement saying he was \"monitoring reports\" about the incident. \"During this event, preliminary reports indicate that several individuals became combative and physically assaultive, resulting in the deployment of pepper ball munitions \u2013 a less-than-lethal system that agents are trained to use in order to protect themselves and others from attack,\" he said.

Curtis died Thursday of cancer. John Poole/NPR hide caption Lois Curtis was the plaintiff in a civil rights case that gave people with disabilities and older people the right to live outside of institutions and in their own homes. Curtis died Thursday of cancer. Attorney Sue Jamieson was touring a grim state hospital in Georgia three decades ago when she was introduced to a young woman, Lois Curtis, who'd spent much of her teen years and early 20's in state institutions. \"As we always say, 'What is it you think we could do for you? I work at Legal Aid. And I'm a lawyer,'\" Jamieson recalled for an oral history for her employer, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. \"And she'd say: 'Get me out of here. Would you please get me out of here? When am I getting out of here?'\" Curtis, who had an intellectual disability and was diagnosed with mental illness, kept calling Jamieson from the hospital, asking when she could get out. The lawsuit that Jamieson filed on behalf of Curtis and another woman \u2013 L.C. v. Olmstead \u2013 led to a landmark Supreme Court decision benefitting elderly and disabled people, and ultimately helped Curtis move out of institutional care and into her own home. Curtis, 55, died in her own home outside of Atlanta on Thursday. The cause was pancreatic cancer. The Supreme Court ruled in 1999, in a decision delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that Curtis, her co-plaintiff Elaine Wilson and other people with disabilities had a right\u2014under the Americans with Disabilities Act\u2014to live in a \"less restrictive setting.\" The landmark civil rights case gave disabled and elderly people a right to seek long-term care services in their own home, instead of in an institution like a nursing home or a psychiatric hospital. Curtis \"created a sea change in what our service systems look like,\" says Alison Barkoff, the top federal official for aging and disability policy. \"We went from a system in 1999 that the only places that most people with disabilities and older adults could get services were in institutions like nursing homes and psychiatric hospitals, to systems that are primarily focused on supporting people with services in their own homes,\" says Barkoff, the acting administrator and assistant secretary of aging at the Administration for Community Living at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. After the Olmstead decision, state Medicaid budgets shifted. Today, more money goes to pay for care at home. Less government funding goes to pay for care in institutions. Federal law makes nursing home care an entitlement for people who meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. Home-based care, although it is more popular and became a right under the Olmstead decision, is not an entitlement. As a result, there are long waiting lists for care at home\u2014 at least 700,000 people waiting in some 40 states . But the Olmstead decision requires every state to move toward providing more of that care at home. The Olmstead decision is cited in scores of lawsuits to get others out of institutional care. And its use has spread. The U.S. Department of Justice, in the Obama Administration, applied the decision's wording that people with disabilities are entitled to live in the \"less restrictive environment\" to sue to end segregated work programs that pay people with disabilities a sub-minimum wage. Now parents use Olmstead to assert their children should be in integrated classrooms. The argument behind the Olmstead decision was that when people live fully integrated in their communities, they live better, more fulfilling lives. Curtis proved it. She moved into a series of houses, needing help from a caregiver with things like cooking, shopping and other care. And there she discovered her talent as an artist\u2014something she didn't get to develop when she lived in state hospitals. Curtis made pencil and pastel drawings of animals and flowers. And sometimes she drew people whose pictures she saw in magazines and books\u2014like a serious Martin Luther King with his arms crossed or a shirtless, young Muhammad Ali. In 2011, she was invited to the White House on the anniversary of the Olmstead decision. She presented President Barack Obama a framed picture she called \"Girl in an Orange Dress.\" It was one of a series of self-portraits Curtis did of herself as a young girl, because she had no photographs from the years she lived in the state psychiatric hospitals. Curtis used her artwork to meet people, says Lee Sanders, who was first hired to help Curtis find work and then became a friend. Curtis, Sanders wrote, \"created artwork as she lived: Her lines drawn without hesitation, her colors bold and saturated, her images uncomplicated and spirited.\" Curtis was very social and, with her quick smile, was gifted at making friends.

Julio Cortez/AP hide caption More government data points to alcohol's increasing role in U.S deaths, including a new report that found that the alcohol-induced death rate rose nearly 30% during the first year of the COVID pandemic. NEW YORK \u2014 The rate of deaths that can be directly attributed to alcohol rose nearly 30% in the U.S. during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new government data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had already said the overall number of such deaths rose in 2020 and 2021. Two reports from the CDC this week provided further details on which groups have the highest death rates and which states are seeing the largest numbers. \"Alcohol is often overlooked\" as a public health problem, said Marissa Esser, who leads the CDC's alcohol program. \"But it is a leading preventable cause of death.\" A report released Friday focused on more than a dozen kinds of \"alcohol-induced\" deaths that were wholly blamed on drinking. Examples include alcohol-caused liver or pancreas failure, alcohol poisoning, withdrawal and certain other diseases. There were more than 52,000 such deaths last year, up from 39,000 in 2019. The rate of such deaths had been increasing in the two decades before the pandemic, by 7% or less each year. In 2020, they rose 26%, to about 13 deaths per 100,000 Americans. That's the highest rate recorded in at least 40 years, said the study's lead author, Merianne Spencer. Such deaths are 2 1/2 times more common in men than in women, but rose for both in 2020, the study found. The rate continued to be highest for people ages 55 to 64, but rose dramatically for certain other groups, including jumping 42% among women ages 35 to 44. The second report, published earlier this week in JAMA Network Open, looked at a wider range of deaths that could be linked to drinking, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides, falls and cancers. More than 140,000 of that broader category of alcohol-related deaths occur annually, based on data from 2015 to 2019, the researchers said. CDC researchers say about 82,000 of those deaths are from drinking too much over a long period of time and 58,000 from causes tied to acute intoxication. The study found that as many as 1 in 8 deaths among U.S. adults ages 20 to 64 were alcohol-related deaths. New Mexico was the state with the highest percentage of alcohol-related deaths, 22%. Mississippi had the lowest, 9% Excessive drinking is associated with chronic dangers such as liver cancer, high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Drinking by pregnant women can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects. And health officials say alcohol is a factor in as many as one-third of serious falls among the elderly. It's also a risk to others through drunken driving or alcohol-fueled violence. Surveys suggest that more than half the alcohol sold in the U.S. is consumed during binge drinking episodes. Even before the pandemic, U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up , and Americans were drinking more than when Prohibition was enacted. But deaths may have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic began for several reasons, including people with alcohol-related illnesses may have had more trouble getting medical care, Esser said. She added that the research points to a need to look at steps to reduce alcohol consumption, including increasing alcohol taxes and enacting measures that limit where people can buy beer, wine and liquor.", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "npr", "category": "health", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [1.454230546951294, 17.167978286743164]}, {"title": "Shop AOC!

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Queens, Bronx) is running a robust retail operation that would make Jeff Bezos envious, shelling out $2 million since January 2021 on campaign merch that is flying off the shelves. The products hawked on her campaign website include $58 \u201cTax the Rich\u201d sweatshirts \u2014 currently sold out \u2014 $28 Green New Deal hats and $27 tees that say \u201cDrink Water & Don\u2019t Be A Racist.\u201d A \u201cBetter World Is Possible\u201d sweatshirt for $58 is sold out in all but one size. Like true cut-throat capitalists, the campaign appears to have marked up the AOC gear by more than double the wholesale cost. The bulk purchase price for plain black sweatshirts, similar to the one used for the \u201cTax the Rich\u201d item, is $22.84. \u201cEspousing one set of beliefs while practicing another might be the most typically liberal thing about AOC ,\u201d said GOP consultant Luke Thompson. The campaign buys the goods from Financial Innovations, a Cranston, RI wholesaler specializing in custom political products that it touts as being made in the US or Canada in union shops. The AOC campaign gave the company $1.8 million worth of business, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data which covers the period from Dec. 25, 2020, through Aug. 3, 2022. The campaign\u2019s merchandising expenses also included $49,948 to the e-commerce business Shopify for various website-related costs and at least $4,400 in design fees for the merchandise. It is unclear how much the congresswoman\u2019s campaign made off the sale of the tees, shirts, hats, socks, pins, and other goods. A purchase is considered a campaign donation and is not specifically itemized in FEC records as a merchandise sale. But records show the campaign raked in $11.7 million in the current election cycle. It\u2019s not that she needs the money. Ocasio-Cortez is expected to handily defeat Republican opponent Tina Forte, who has raised a meager $1.2 million. The two-term Democratic Socialist\u2019s high-priced apparel line became a debate point this week in AOC\u2019s Twitter spat with Elon Musk.

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted back that she was \u201cproud\u201d of her merchandise, adding \u201cNot to mention all proceeds go to community organizing like our Homework Helpers program which gives private tutoring to kids who\u2019ve needed learning support since COVID: Check out our shop!\u201d Campaign filings show that only $10,917 has gone to community groups since January 2021, including $4,217 to the Start Lighthouse organization in the Bronx for the Homework Helpers program; $5,000 to IOBY in Brooklyn, a crowd-funding group; $300 to the Poppenhusen Institute community center; $400 to New Immigrant Community Empowerment; $500 to the City Parks Foundation, and $500 to a group only described as City IslandO. \u201cOur campaign directly runs several charitable programs, including regular food distributions.

Jordan Bardella, a 27-year-old of Italian descent, was chosen by party members as their new chief on Saturday. Marine Le Pen, daughter of the party\u2019s notorious founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, had been slowly handing leadership powers to the photogenic member of the European Parliament. Bardella, who grew up in Seine Saint-Denis, a rough and ethnically diverse neighborhood just outside Paris, beat Louis Aliot, mayor of Perpignan and Le Pen\u2019s former partner, with a large majority of the vote in an internal National Rally online ballot, Bloomberg News reported. Bardella has been Le Pen\u2019s deputy leader since 2019 and has been key to attracting a younger demographic, especially in rural areas and suburbs. Though Bardella has at times voiced more radical views than Le Pen, he\u2019ll likely continue the efforts she began to bring the party into the mainstream after she took over from her father in 2011, Marta Lorimer, an expert on the French far right at the London School of Economics, told Bloomberg News. \u201cEven though he\u2019s more of an Identitarian than Marine Le Pen, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll take the party in a different direction from where it currently is,\u201d said Lorimer, referencing Bardella\u2019s views on non-white immigration. Le Pen made Bardella acting president last year when she stepped back to run for president. She failed for a third time to win but the far right secured its strongest result ever. The party went on to win 89 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly election, another record. Le Pen will continue to be the party\u2019s leader in parliament and is expected to run for president again in 2027.

The conference comes one year after COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where leaders from around the world, including nations with the highest emissions, signed a non-binding climate agreement resembling previous pacts. Shortly following the agreement, though, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres downplayed the agreement and paved the way for COP27. \"It's an important step, but it's not enough,\" he said at the time. \"It's time to go into emergency mode.\" Groups, including Greenpeace International, similarly criticized the agreement, calling it a \"polite request.\" UN BRUSHES OFF CONCERNS ABOUT UPCOMING CLIMATE SUMMIT'S 'HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT' Video Ahead of this year's summit, which is scheduled to begin Monday and conclude on Nov. 18, high-ranking officials in the U.S. and other Western nations have reiterated the importance of solving global warming, which they characterized as the biggest threat facing humanity. \"Among all of the centrifugal forces of these last 20 years, all vying to pull the world apart in many ways, the climate crisis still looms largest as the issue that will change life unalterably. Now, that may sound grandiose, but it is no exaggeration,\" Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, who will lead the American delegation at the event, said in October. \"Existential means existential. It demands that we all work together, because no country can resolve this crisis by itself,\" he continued. \"So it\u2019s especially appropriate to be here, just 12 days before the gavel is going to come down at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh \u2013 and with it, a major accountability moment on this urgent issue.\" JOHN KERRY WILL FLY COMMERCIAL TO UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE FOLLOWING BACKLASH FOR PRIVATE JET CARBON EMISSIONS Kerry added that nations must \"repair the planet at the pace that science demands\" and increase the ability to adapt to cataclysmic global warming. Among the conference's main objectives will be to forward solutions that cut carbon emissions and limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed about one degree above pre-industrial levels, according to the U.N. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry attends COP26 on Nov. 12, 2021.

Western nations have fallen far short of a 2009 U.N. pledge to give $100 billion a year to poor countries for climate mitigation through 2025. Although the Trump administration backed out of climate finance agreements, President Biden has pledged more than $11 billion per year to the developing world for climate mitigation. A group of African and Arab countries have banded together to form the so-called COP27 Coalition ahead of the conference to issue a series of demands for wealthy nations. Among the demands, the coalition said the West should \"provide finance, technology and capacity to developing countries.\" BIDEN PLEDGES TO MOBILIZE PRESIDENCY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE: 'CODE RED FOR HUMANITY' \"We're telling developing nations that we don't want them to go through the process of developing, we don't want them to have coal or natural gas or even nuclear,\" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"We want them to use wind and solar, which is intermittent, which is ineffective, which is incredibly cost prohibitive.\" \"Along with climate financing is a lot of energy poverty and we're very comfortable plunging certain sectors of the world, even certain sectors of the American population, into energy poverty,\" he said.

In addition to Kerry, President Biden and several top administration officials are expected to travel to Egypt for the conference. And U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reversed his decision not to attend COP27, saying climate action was essential to long-term prosperity and energy security. However, China and India, two of the world's largest emitters, are expected to send a slimmed-down delegation compared to past conferences, calling into doubt whether any agreement reached could have a significant impact. China accounts for about 27% of total global emissions \u2013 nearly tripling the total in the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, according to Rhodium Group \u2013 and continues to approve and construct a large amount of coal power plants. CHINA HALTS MILITARY, CLIMATE TALKS WITH US IN RETALIATION FOR PELOSI VISIT \"That should be the first priority, or the maybe the first agenda item at the conference. If climate is a global issue and two of the world's largest emitters are not participating, then all the rest of our reductions, or our pledges, are absolutely meaningless,\" Turner said. \"China is bringing more coal online. They're bringing more coal online than we currently have in the United States,\" he continued. \"Why would America make any efforts to cut something like coal, when it's being completely offset, or exacerbated, by what China's doing?\" President Joe Biden meets with China's President Xi Jinping during a virtual summit on Nov. 15, 2021.

Amid the crisis, Europeans have been forced to take drastic measures to conserve energy and keep bills low while governments have imposed rationing rules and introduced relief programs. In the U.S., energy prices have surged due to a similar crisis. Home heating costs alone are expected to rise another 17.8% this winter compared to last year.

Drop me a line and let me know. In the meantime, let\u2019s get to this week\u2019s round-up. \u2018Blockbuster\u2019 True confession: I have my old Blockbuster membership card somewhere around here. I was a regular at my neighborhood store in Baltimore which is why I was thrilled when I learned of this new comedy series based on the #throwback movie rental chain. In the eponymous show, Randall Park plays Timmy Yoon, \u201can analog dreamer living in a 5G world\u201d who manages the last Blockbuster location out there. He\u2019s out to prove his store provides \u201csomething big corporations can\u2019t: human connection.\u201d What a great message. The series is streaming on Netflix now. Yes, you read that right \u2013 you can now stream a show about movie rentals. \u2018Hip Hop Homicides\u2019 Sadly, with the recent death of rapper Takeoff, this new WEtv show feels more timely than ever. Produced by 50 Cent and Mona Scott-Young, and hosted by Van Lathan, the series will be \u201ctaking a \u2018big picture\u2019 look at the epidemic of violence in hip hop.\u201d Given that at least one rapper has lost his life every year to gun violence since 2018, the topic is ripe for examination. The first episode, which looks at the 2020 murder of rapper Pop Smoke, is available on WEtv. \u2018Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me\u2019 Celebrity confessionals are popular for good reason. They serve as a reminder that, no matter how young, rich, famous or good looking you may be, life can still be a challenge. That appears to be the message within Selena Gomez\u2019s new documentary \u201cMy Mind & Me,\u201d in which she gets vulnerable about her world and her mental health . In my opinion, this sort of first-person advocacy is one of the best uses of a celeb\u2019s platform \u2013 because it can help others to realize that they are not alone. \u201cSelena Gomez: My Mind & Me\u201d is streaming on Apple TV+. \u2018Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me\u2019 A strange phone call reveals a question from beyond the grave \u2013 was The Godfather of Soul murdered ?

Decades later, she finds herself trying to solve the mystery of Brown\u2019s death . When she makes a call to CNN reporter Thomas Lake, the two stumble into a world of secrets, intimidation, and suspected foul play. \u201cThe James Brown Mystery\u201d podcast is currently streaming on CNN Audio. Spice up your life! To celebrate the 25th anniversary of their second album\u2019s release, the iconic British girl group have curated a new version of the record, \u201cSpiceworld25,\u201d bringing together the hits, their favorite B-sides, some live concert recordings and a \u201cSpice Girls Party Mix\u201d mash-up. It\u2019s kind of wild that Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown, Geri Halliwell and Victoria Beckham have been around that long, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to reminisce about how caught up in their girl power so many of us were \u2013 and still are it seems. The album is out now. By far my favorite story of this week was the tale of how Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King paid the hospital bill for Julia Roberts\u2019 birth . It was the perfect combination of \u201cWait, what?\u201d and \u201cHow cool is that?\u201d The story itself has been here and there on social media since Roberts shared it with journalist Gayle King in September as part of the History Channel\u2019s \u201cHISTORYTalks\u201d series, but gained traction in particular during fans\u2019 celebration of Roberts\u2019 55th birthday on October 28. No matter how the story broke through, I\u2019m glad it did. \u201cWelcome to the Jenaissance\u201d read the headline of a recent Vogue magazine story on Jennifer Coolidge, and I think that perfectly captures it. \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d star is having a moment \u2013 and we love to see it. Not only did Coolidge win an Emmy in September for her work on the hit HBO show , but she also has a role in the buzzy Netflix series \u201cThe Watcher.\u201d Coolidge is getting a kick out of it as well. She told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon this week that, \u201cIt\u2019s way more enjoyable if you never expected the moment to happen.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the surprise of it all that makes it so fun,\u201d she added during an interview which aired Wednesday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cI truly believe if I expected all this to happen it never would have.\u201d In Hollywood, being 61 and still killing it on screen continues \u2013 sadly \u2013 to be a rare triumph. But Coolidge is an institution, having appeared in so many movies that have helped define pop culture, from \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d to \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d to \u201cBest in Show,\u201d to name just a few.

A serial thief wearing a blue baseball cap walked into the branch on Oct. 20 and handed over a note saying \u201cThis is a bank robbery, I have a gun, open the drawer and pass me the money.\u201d He did not display a weapon and fled with about $760, the NYPD said. The same bearded robber is suspected in two of the other robberies at the branch as well as in 15 other heists in Queens and Manhattan at Chase, Citi and Santander banks \u2014 walking away with a total of about $15,000, police said. Video from a May robbery at a Capital One branch in Queens shows the suspect, who is wearing a baseball cap with \u201cNew York\u201d on it and a zippered sweatshirt, sauntering into the branch carrying a paper shopping bag but without a mask or other facial covering. The brazen thief has struck several branches repeatedly. He is alleged to have hit the East 57th Street TD branch on June 8, taking $520, and on Sept. 1. making off with $545, police said. The branch was also robbed on March 21 when a different suspect made off with $1,268, the NYPD said. A customer at the targeted TD Bank said that she \u201cwished\u201d the news about all the heists \u201csurprised me a bit more.\u201d \u201cIt does make me question more about what times I want to stop by or use the ATM, or when I go in if it seems there\u2019s enough people around, although sometimes that doesn\u2019t seem to be a deterrent,\u201d said the 28-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Lizzie. A security guard at the bank was alarmed by the repeated robberies. \u201cThey\u2019re beginning to not care,\u201d the guard said about the thieves. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d Nationwide, the number of bank robberies fell from 2,440 in 2019 to 1,724 in 2021. The nationwide peak came in 1991 with 9,388 robberies. A TD bank spokesman said, \u201cThe safety of our customers and colleagues is a top priority. We have security measures in place, and when robberies occur, we work closely with law enforcement and offer programs to support impacted TD colleagues.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [8.003281593322754, 13.080070495605469]}, {"title": "HBO cancels 'Westworld' after four seasons: 'It has been a privilege'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hbo-cancels-westworld-four-seasons-privilege", "description": "HBO made the shocking decision to stop production of \"Westworld\" after airing the series for four seasons.

Last week, Wake Forest lost to Louisville, 48-21, in one of the oddest college football games you\u2019ll ever see. The Demon Deacons committed six turnovers \u2026 in the third quarter. Overall, Wake turned the ball over eight times and Louisville scored two defensive touchdowns. I was on Louisville +4, but now, we have a great bounce-back spot for Wake Forest as a 3-point favorite at North Carolina State. We are getting some value on this line because of the debacle last Saturday. If the Demon Deacons had won that game, this line would be closer to -7. That\u2019s the kind of performance I throw out the window because it\u2019s not the norm for QB Sam Hartman and the Wake Forest offense. The Wolfpack are also down to backup quarterbacks Jack Chambers and MJ Morris, after starter Devin Leary was lost for the season. Without Leary, N.C. State is averaging just 16.6 points per game. I don\u2019t see the Wolfpack keeping up with Wake Forest\u2019s potent offense on Saturday. Wake Forest vs. North Carolina State prediction: Wake Forest -3 ( Caesars Sportsbook ). Memphis comes in the loser of three straight. If any team needs a bye, it\u2019s the Tigers. Memphis lost two close, gut-wrenching games to Houston and East Carolina. The Tigers needed a mental break and now return home where they have been much more profitable under coach Ryan Silverfield. The home team has also dominated this series over the last decade, going a remarkable 11-0 ATS. UCF\u2019s starting quarterback John Rhys Plumlee is questionable with an injury, so it could be backup Mikey Keene getting the start on the road.

I think Clemson is the most overrated team in the country. The Tigers beat Wake Forest, Florida State and Syracuse each by six points. I expect another tight game on Saturday night. This isn\u2019t a great Notre Dame team by any means, but Clemson enters the game with question marks at quarterback and is laying more than a field goal in a hostile environment.

My sources have been money with early quarterback information. Two weeks ago, I heard Minnesota QB Tanner Morgan wouldn\u2019t play. He didn\u2019t, and Penn State covered. Last week, I heard Toledo QB Dequan Finn wouldn\u2019t play. He didn\u2019t, and Eastern Michigan covered. This week, I\u2019m hearing Kansas QB Jalon Daniels is likely to return on Saturday. Daniels was a Heisman Trophy candidate before getting injured against TCU. Speaking of injuries, Oklahoma State has been decimated, and that showed last week in a 48-0 trouncing at Kansas State.

They have more than 5.5 million Instagram followers between them. Two of the three date NFL players. They also \u2014 to paraphrase the most famous of the bunch, former Miss Universe Olivia \u2014 have no boundaries, no filter, and no personal space. Naturally, they now have a reality show. \u201cThe Culpo Sisters\u201d debuts Nov. 7 on TLC/Discovery+, and it follows siblings Aurora, Olivia, and Sophia as they live, laugh, love, and post-spon-con in sunny Los Angeles. And just as Olivia promised, they really don\u2019t hide anything from the camera. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been an open book,\u201d Olivia, 30, told The Post. Plus, she added, \u201cOur family is quite wacky.\u201d \u201cBats\u2013t crazy,\u201d little sis Sophia agreed. In one episode, Aurora, a 33-year-old mommy blogger and the sole blonde in the group, starts talking about the previous night\u2019s sex with her husband during a \u201cEuphoria\u201d-themed party. (She filed for divorce from \u201cSurvivor\u201d contestant Michael Bortone in April.) Fashion influencer Olivia tortures her family with her cello-playing for their parents\u2019 35th anniversary. \u201cI like watching [Mom\u2019s] face when you play and she\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s kind of painful but she wants to be sweet and grateful but she would rather you stop,\u201d Sophia recalled with glee. As for the 26-year-old \u201cbaby\u201d Sophia, she helps herself to her sibling\u2019s brand-new designer stilettos without asking for permission. It\u2019s not the only time in the series when Sophia filches her sisters\u2019 belongings \u2014 prompting Olivia to get a padlock for her closet door. Sophia remained unapologetic when the Culpo crew spoke with The Post. \u201cWhat are sisters for if not for their closets?\u201d she said, smiling. Aurora nodded, pointing to the gold posts in her ears: \u201cI\u2019m wearing Olivia\u2019s earrings right now.\u201d \u201cThe Culpo Sisters\u201d is mostly a romp, but the trio navigates some pretty serious, emotional territory too, including romance, heartache, divorce, and \u2014 of course \u2014 sibling rivalry. \u201cI really thought that these types of reality shows were more contrived than they are,\u201d said Aurora. \u201cI thought that we would have to be doing a little bit of acting or fabricating, but there really wasn\u2019t any. They really do just follow you around all day, every day \u2026 I realized that the way they get drama out of you is that you\u2019re so tired that everything just comes to the surface, and it ends up being a great show.\u201d The sisters do share a few traits with the most famous reality-star siblings, the Kardashians: They\u2019re wellness/beauty/fashion peddlers, have various brands or businesses, and often dress provocatively. But unlike Kim & Ko., these ladies hail from small-town New England and grew up in an eccentric, artsy family who had little interest in fame, celebrity, or designer labels. And they still don\u2019t. \u201cThey call Olivia an influencer, but we don\u2019t know why because we\u2019re not influenced by it,\u201d their bemused mom, Susan, says at one point in the show. The siblings and their two brothers, Pete and Gus \u2014 who, along with the parents, appear intermittently in the new series \u2014 were born in Cranston, RI Their father, Peter, opened several restaurants in the Boston area; mom Susan played viola for various groups, including the Boston Symphony and the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra. \u201cWe were all so close in age \u2014 there\u2019s five of us within eight years \u2014 and our parents worked all the time, and so we had to rely on each other,\u201d Olivia said. The older kids cooked, cleaned, and babysat the younger ones, letting them stay up late until they heard their dad\u2019s car screeching into the driveway and had to spring upstairs to bed as fast as they could so they wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d she said. Aurora was the mothering, sometimes domineering older sister; Sophia was the coddled baby. \u201cSophia was like my child,\u201d Aurora said. \u201cI used to carry her and French braid her hair.\u201d Meanwhile, Olivia \u2014 the classic middle child \u2014 clamored for attention. \u201cI used to just beg Aurora, \u2018Can I just have a hug? Can I just follow you around all day?\u2019\u201d she recalled. Olivia was a self-professed \u201cnerd\u201d who spent her summers at band camp and played the cello. But that all changed during her sophomore year at Boston University when she decided to try out for Miss Rhode Island. She had never been in a pageant before \u2014 it was not how her family rolled; her mom didn\u2019t even wear makeup. Olivia wore a dress that she rented for $20 and later realized had a hole in it. No matter. She won that title, then won Miss USA, and then won Miss Universe in 2012. Suddenly, she was a celebrity, traveling the world and dating singer Nick Jonas. She ended up going with him to Los Angeles. When they broke up, Olivia realized she had no identity , no way of making a living, and no plan. She didn\u2019t even have money to buy groceries. That\u2019s when she decided that she had to take matters into her own hands. Fast-forward about a decade later, and Olivia \u2014 now joined on the West Coast by Aurora and Sophia \u2014 has a whopping 5.3 million followers on Instagram . She\u2019s posed for Sports Illustrated\u2019s Swimsuit Issue. Her sisters have joined the Instagram-influencer hustle too. The idea for a reality show actually came from Instagram. \u201cWe were getting an overwhelming amount of feedback, with people saying, \u2018We love you guys together, please do a show!\u2019\u201d Olivia said. \u201cAnd then we started to realize that we had a lot of fun working together.\u201d \u201cWe already share so much of our lives [on social media],\u201d Aurora added. \u201c[So] we were like, \u2018Why not give the producing part to someone else?\u2019\u201d The family began filming the series in October. By the time they wrapped, their lives had gotten much more dramatic than they had anticipated. Sophia ended up moving out of Olivia\u2019s house in LA and going to New York City, to be with her boyfriend, New York Jets player Braxton Berrios. Aurora and her husband of two-and-a-half years decided to split, leaving her navigating a divorce while raising two young children \u2014 son Remi and daughter Solei. \u201cI felt like the timing couldn\u2019t have been any worse,\u201d Aurora recalled. \u201cWe decided to get divorced in November \u2026 so it really did happen right while we were filming. And it was really hard, but I had made a commitment to be vulnerable, for the sake of our audience, and to allow people to get to know us a little bit more.\u201d That led to Olivia \u2014 who has also dated NFL player Danny Amendola and former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow \u2014 opining about her own relationships, saying that she always thought by the age of 30 she would be married and have kids. At one point in the show, she breaks down discussing an ex-boyfriend who treated her as \u201cless than human.\u201d She is now in a loving relationship with Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers, and \u2014 while she previously swore she would never date another football player \u2014 she finally embraces her WAG status proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s a real-time commitment, and it\u2019s just an incredible sport, and they\u2019re the best at what they do and at that level, it takes an insane amount of dedication and focus. So there\u2019s a lot of times when you don\u2019t necessarily come first and that\u2019s something you get used to as a WAG, but we do it proudly!\u201d she said. Despite all the drama, the sisters said making the show has brought them even closer together. \u201cThe fights [were] epic, but we\u2019re kind of like toddlers,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cWe have a five-second rebound.\u201d But she still hasn\u2019t removed the padlock from her closet \u2014 after all, Sophia still visits a lot. \u201cThat\u2019s still there. Everybody listening?\u201d she said, eying her sisters. \u201cThat is still there.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-1.6238632202148438, 2.029294967651367]}, {"title": "Labrador retriever mix rescued from Texas and now in New York needs a loving home", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/retriever-mix-rescued-texas-new-york-needs-home", "description": "Nine-year-old Labrador retriever mix named Ethel Mertz is available for adoption at Badass Animal Rescue in Brooklyn, New York, after the dog was taken from Dallas, Texas, during a rescue mission.", "content": "close Video Lawrence Jones gives training update on dog Nala Lawrence and his new dog Nala train alongside decorated military dog Raptor.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard \u2013 the video game company behind titles like \"Guitar Hero,\" \"Candy Crush,\" \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Call of Duty\" \u2013 in the largest tech acquisitions in history. Antitrust regulators are assessing whether the deal could hurt competition in the booming global video game industry, for numerous reasons including the fact that Microsoft already produces the widely used Xbox gaming console. Further consolidation in the tech industry elicits well deserved skepticism from regulators, but they should also consider how this deal could help America\u2019s greatest geopolitical adversary: China. To understand how, it\u2019s first important to understand Microsoft\u2019s long and close relationship with the People\u2019s Republic of China and its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Microsoft has operated in China for three decades, boasting on its website that its \"most complete subsidiary and largest R&D center outside the United States is in China.\" Microsoft Research Asia (MRA) has trained thousands of Chinese AI researchers, including top executives at companies like Huawei, whose products have been deemed such a security risk that the company is sanctioned by the U.S. government and rejected by free nations around the world. UK TIGHTENS SECURITY OVER HACKING FEARS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA Microsoft-trained tech talent played integral roles in building China\u2019s oppressive surveillance state. A Financial Times report recently exposed that Microsoft itself worked \"with a Chinese military-run university on artificial intelligence research that could be used for surveillance and censorship.\" It is also widely known that China\u2019s boundless national security laws require companies, including Microsoft, to fork over any data that the CCP deems necessary for \"public safety.\" With these, and many other, examples of Microsoft\u2019s close relationship with China, it\u2019s no wonder that one Chinese government official glowingly declared that Bill Gates was \"bigger in China than any movie star.\" TheUSS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) and USS Nimitz (CVN 68) Carrier Strike Groups steam in formation, in the South China Sea, Monday, July 6, 2020. (US NAVY) (Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Jason Tarleton/U.S. Navy via AP) The second thing to understand is that China\u2019s government is ready to make serious moves in the video game industry \u2013 moves that could have major national security implications. According to China government-affiliated news outlet Global Times, one of the Chinese regime's top political advisors bemoaned the fact that \"Chinese officers and soldiers are playing war computer games made mainly by foreign companies that could convey wrong values,\" including the \"ideologies of so-called 'democracy' and 'liberty.'\" He called for the government to \"boost funding and policy support to the domestic video game industry\" to not only display \"the good image of the Chinese military,\" but also to possibly use video games to train their troops. \"We need to push forward to develop independent and regulated military-themed video games and explore how to use them scientifically in assisting military training,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The third thing to understand is that China has a proven industry takeover playbook that they are poised to run in the video game industry. For a preview of what\u2019s to come, look no further than the film industry. The CCP lured Hollywood in with the promise of new moviegoers, controlled and manipulated the content as best it could, acquired the industry's technical and creative expertise over time, and built up its own distribution capacity. Now its propaganda films are among the highest grossing movies of all time. Video It\u2019s not hard to see the same process being deployed with video games, with Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard as the catalyst. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At a time when Microsoft is doubling down on its investments and expansions in China, what will the CCP make Microsoft-Activision do? Will China force the merged company to censor any video games that it believes are \"pro-Western?\" Will the Chinese government require Microsoft to develop tools for their military? Tencent, the Chinese technology and entertainment conglomerate, already has a partnership with Activision, including a 5% stake in the company. Will China\u2019s leverage over Activision only expand when its longtime partner Microsoft is in charge? These are questions that lawmakers on Capitol Hill should be raising and every regulator should be asking of Microsoft before blessing a merger that expands the power of the world\u2019s second most-valuable company, particularly one that is so chummy with the CCP.

It\u2019s time to restore common sense to the governor\u2019s office It\u2019s the classic question often asked at election time: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Under Gretchen Whitmer as governor, the answer here in Michigan is a resounding \"No!\" I\u2019m running for governor because it\u2019s time to restore a little common sense to Lansing. Our economy is lagging behind other states, violent crime is out of control, our education system is failing our children, and our roads haven\u2019t been fixed. As a candidate in 2018, Whitmer promised to address all these problems, and now that things have gotten worse, is asking to be rehired.

No state had more small businesses close down this past summer than Michigan. We are still more than 80,000 jobs shy of where we were pre-pandemic, and we are worse than most other states in unemployment, job growth, and inflation. A SIMPLE GUIDE TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS, HOW THEY AFFECT THE PRESIDENCY, AND MORE Whitmer has vetoed tax cuts for small businesses and stood in the way of tax relief for individuals. And she broke an emphatic promise by trying to triple the gas tax to 45 cents per gallon. Republican Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon speaks with Fox News' Brandon Gillespie in an interview on Tuesday, July 26, 2022. (Brandon Gillespie) When I\u2019m governor, we will begin a phase-out of the state income tax like nine other states, so that families have more control over their own finances and entrepreneurs can plow money back into their businesses to create jobs. We will improve workforce training and expose more students to high-demand skilled trades, where there are high-paying career opportunities. And we will unleash entrepreneurs, unlock economic growth, and attract new businesses and talent to Michigan by eliminating 40 percent of Michigan\u2019s burdensome regulations . No society can function properly if communities are not safe. Under Whitmer, violent crime has skyrocketed statewide, while she has endorsed the goals of the \"Defund the Police\" movement, which would hurt people who live in neighborhoods that need law enforcement the most. She vetoed funding for the State Police and made tracking sex offenders and parolees more difficult. PARENTS WILL CALL THE SHOTS IN NOVEMBER\u2019S ELECTIONS AND RECLAIM OUR CULTURE In a Dixon administration, we\u2019ll recruit and train thousands of new police officers, emergency personnel, state troopers, and local and state corrections officers. We will combat sex crimes by enhancing penalties for predators and providing better support for victims. We will fight illegal immigration by banning sanctuary cities and keep cash bail in place so that violent criminals and repeat offenders are not released into our neighborhoods to terrorize citizens again. Video Despite Whitmer\u2019s lie in our last debate that our schools were only closed for three months because of COVID-19 lockdown s, parents and kids know differently. Whitmer\u2019s lockdowns were excessive, and as a result, test scores in reading and math fell off a cliff while enrollment and graduation rates also have fallen.

We\u2019ll remove critical race theory from classrooms and stop discussing sex and gender theory with kids in 3rd grade and below.

The find \u2013 a partially decomposed human arm from the elbow to the fingertips \u2013 led police to the remains of a young couple who had been tied up and killed in a dense woodland on the outskirts of Houston. For 40 years, the victims were nameless \u2013 until late 2021, when a team of genetic genealogists identified the pair as Dean and Tina Clouse, a young married couple who had moved from Florida to Texas for work.

Webster told reporters that two women, who were part of a \"nomadic religious group,\" dropped Holly off at a church in Yuma, Arizona, in late 1980. The child was raised by a pastor, who is not considered a suspect, Webster said. Still, the announcement prompted new questions: Who were the women? To what group did they belong?

The official word was that it was consensual. Nash, 48, in his third season as head coach of the Nets, tweeted the news like it was a retirement party, thanking his former team for the \u201camazing experience with many challenges\u201d and for letting him \u201cbe a part of this beautiful community.\u201d But Nets General Manager Sean Marks was a bit more forthright, saying at a news conference that Nash never had \u201can even playing field.\u201d That\u2019s a nice way of saying that Nash, who was hired as the team\u2019s head coach in 2020, didn\u2019t have the support of his team. Or, as Charles Barkley less-than-nicely said it earlier this week on \u201cInside the NBA,\u201d several Nets players \u2014 most notably Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons \u2014 were \u201c acting like fools and jackasses .\u201d Barkley isn\u2019t wrong. Since Nash took the reins, their antics included refusing to get vaccinated , being publicly anti-Semitic \u2014 which got Irving suspended without pay for at least five games \u2014 and demanding that Nash get fired ; not a good look for any team, in any sport. Probably the best perspective on what happened came from Steve Kerr, the nine-time NBA champion (five as a player and four as a coach) and head coach for the Golden State Warriors, who called Nash\u2019s exit a \u201cgood reminder to me and I think to all coaches that we are all at the whim of players, front offices, ownership.\u201d Nash has become a canary in the coalmine for modern basketball coaching. He\u2019s proof that it\u2019s not just about winning and losing anymore. As John Lucas III, an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers who runs a training program for aspiring NBA coaches, told The New York Times this summer, a core tenant of being a successful coach in 2022 is \u201cbeing able to deal with egos.\u201d Which isn\u2019t entirely new. Phil Jackson, who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships during the \u201990s, had to deal with some massive and unreasonable egos, whether it was Michael Jordan suddenly quitting to play baseball or Dennis Rodman disappearing to party in Vegas or wrestle with Hulk Hogan . But none of it ever felt like a major distraction to Jackson. As he wrote in his book, \u201c Eleven Rings: The Soul of Success ,\u201d he had a Zen monk approach to managing stars. \u201cGive them a lot of room and encourage them to be mischievous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThen watch them.\u201d \"This is all on Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons. Steve Nash is a scapegoat.\" Chucks shares his thoughts on the Nets pic.twitter.com/DxZgtQoUn9 Of course, it was easier to let players be mischievous in the last century, before social media existed. Now managing players is harder than ever before. And it\u2019s even worse for NCAA coaches, who have to contend with the transfer portal, created in 2018 to allow players to leapfrog between schools without getting penalized. Throw in the new image and likeness rule \u2014 student-athletes can now profit from everything from social media posts to in-person appearances \u2014 and coaches are spending more time doing damage control off the court than on. It\u2019s at least part of the reason why iconic coach Jay Wright, 60, announced his retirement last April, after 21 seasons coaching at Villanova University and more than three decades in a Hall of Fame career that included two national championships and eight Big East regular-season titles. \u201cI started to feel just like I didn\u2019t have the edge that I\u2019ve always had,\u201d he explained during a news conference. He didn\u2019t elaborate on exactly what he meant by \u201cedge,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to read between the lines. It felt like the same soft-shoeing I heard from the coach of my five-year-old\u2019s tee-ball baseball league when he abruptly quit, telling the parents only that he wasn\u2019t able to \u201cgive your kiddos the attention they deserve.\u201d What he was really saying was, \u201cYour kids are eating grass and they all have ADHD, and one of them pooped his pants sliding into third base. This is not what I signed up for.\u201d That\u2019s what pro sports coaching has become. They\u2019re glorified tee-ball coaches with better salaries but equally migraine-inducing demands. Is there really a difference between the coach who has to tell the outfielders to stop chasing squirrels and focus, and the coach who has to ask his star players to please cut it out with the anti-Semitic tweets ? I don\u2019t blame Nash or Wright for getting the hell out, any more than I blamed my son\u2019s tee-ball coach for finding a better way to spend his weekend.

Now, barely a week since his fellow billionaire businessman Elon Musk snapped up Twitter for $44 billion, Dorsey, 46, is launching a social media company called Bluesky : a new kind of decentralized platform that promises to give users and developers more autonomy. More than 30,000 subscribers have already signed up, the company tweeted on Oct. 20. Bluesky, which is in the beta testing phase , was commissioned by Dorsey as an answer to some of the problems he saw at Twitter. While some doubt there\u2019s real interest in yet another social media company, those who know the never-married and childless Dorsey say he has sharp elbows in addition to brains, and that his life and career post-Twitter should not be underestimated. He is currently worth a little less than $4 billion. In an apparent show of confidence in Musk\u2019s takeover, Dorsey, who also founded the monetary-payment company Block, chose to roll over his $1 billion stake \u2014 18 million shares \u2014 in Twitter rather than cashing out. But, sources said, there is resentment among Twitter employees \u2014 half of whom are reportedly expected to lose their jobs under Musk. \u201cJack is hated at Twitter,\u201d a source familiar with the situation told The Post. \u201cThey blame what happened with Elon taking over the company on Jack. Parag [Agrawal, the recently-ousted head of Twitter] and the board think he is this really bad character. \u201cJust look at the stock price before Elon bought it. It was about $37 and had been flat for about ten years. The company hadn\u2019t grown because Jack was gallivanting around on his jet with these models,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut nobody wrote about what a disaster the company was because everyone idolizes Dorsey and thinks he\u2019s the next Steve Jobs.\u201d Dorsey\u2019s reps at Square and Bluesky did not respond to requests for comment. Dorsey may not be a lightning rod for controversy like Musk, Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates, or be perceived as socially awkward like Mark Zuckerberg, but it\u2019s a mistake to think he\u2019s any less Machiavellian or megalomaniacal than the rest of them, several sources who know Dorsey told The Post. \u201cHe was at one point the lowest person in the room at Twitter and then, because he wanted to be the most important person in the room, he was \u2014 and he ended up being CEO,\u201d said author Nick Bilton, who spent time with Dorsey for \u201c Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power Friendship and Betrayal ,\u201d his 2014 book. \u201cHe had three co-founders who have sort of been erased from the history of Twitter, both publicly and financially. When he left this last time he blamed the problems at Twitter on other people. Even though he was on the board and was the CEO! He is incredibly adept at boardroom politics and fending off coups against him.\u201d And he has plenty of people in his corner who foresee a glowing post-Twitter career in his future. \u201cJack\u2019s not hot-headed or hot-blooded,\u201d said Nik Yakovenko, who worked at Twitter under Dorsey from 2015 to 2017. \u201cHe\u2019s a calm person. A lot of [Silicon Valley bosses] are not calm. He is a bit more cerebral. He\u2019s also a lot more sincere than you would think. He\u2019s not that interested in money. He loves nature and the outdoors and he\u2019s very into doing blockchain stuff. It remains to be seen what happens with Bluesky. It\u2019s about decentralizing social media networks in the future to give users more autonomy.\u201d Like many of the big tech bros, Dorsey did not stand out during his childhood, where he suffered with a stutter and had geeky hobbies like studying maps and trains and listening to police scanners. \u201cI loved couriers,\u201d he once said. \u201cYou had this transfer of physical information happening throughout the city and the world. Someone picking up the package, putting it in a bag, going somewhere, taking it out of the bag, giving it to someone else. I thought that was so cool. I wanted to map it, to see that flow on a big screen.\u201d He grew up in modest circumstances in St. Louis, Mo. where his father, Tim, was a medical equipment engineer and his mother, Marcia, a homemaker. The family recently renovated Marcia Dorsey\u2019s childhood home. Her Twitter bio reads: \u201cMother of @jack\u2026 Does that make me the grandmother of Twitter?\u201d Despite dropping out of college, Dorsey\u2019s early foray into creating dispatch software for taxi companies led him to plan for microblogging his status to his friends in real time \u2014 an idea that served as the eventual building block for Twitter, formed in 2006. Along the way Dorsey briefly became a licensed massage therapist and dabbled in modeling and fashion design. In 2019, he detailed 11 of his \u201cwellness habits\u201d which include morning ice baths and saunas, eating just one meal a day and often fasting on weekends, two hours of meditation daily and a daily five-mile walk to work. \u201cDorsey is a rarity in Silicon Valley,\u201d Bilton said. \u201cJack\u2019s more charismatic than most of them. Having a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg is talking to a chatbot. Most are odd and you think, did someone make them in a lab and did they then escape and become CEOs. But with Jack you sense there may be an actual human being in there somewhere.\u201d Dorsey\u2019s charisma \u2014 and massive bank account \u2014 may be why he\u2019s been linked to swimsuit models Flora Carter and Raven Lyn Corneil, yoga instructor Kate Greer , fashion model Lilly Cole and \u201c Boss Bitch \u201d author Nicole Lapin. But the relationships haven\u2019t lasted. \u201cHe bought Raven Lyn an $8 million house in the Hollywood Hills in 2019 but she still broke up with him,\u201d an insider told The Post. \u201cIt was like he was too weird to put up with despite his money.\u201d One Silicon Valley insider said Dorsey keeps a low profile. He first bought a $10 million home overlooking San Francisco Bay in the Seacliff area of the city in 2012 and then bought the property next door for $21 million in late 2018. \u201cJack always seems to be the harbinger of things to come,\u201d the insider told The Post. \u201cHis diet, biohacking, the fasting \u2014 he\u2019s always one of the first ones to do stuff. What he does that seems weird will be seen as trendy and cool three years later \u2026 But he doesn\u2019t participate in the social circuit or the galas. He stays away and sticks with his dude pack.\u201d His current dude pack, however, would be well advised, to watch their pal like a hawk. \u201cJack doesn\u2019t talk to any of [his three] Twitter co-founders anymore,\u201d said another insider of Dorsey\u2019s old friends Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass. \u201cYou can be sure they don\u2019t buy into the BS public narrative that Dorsey is some benign monk CEO walking the earth.

She did what most Americans didn\u2019t do, she signed up and showed up. I was like her in that regard, I also signed up and showed up. I went to the Army, and Jennifer-Ruth to the Air Force.

How could a crime perpetuated against Jennifer-Ruth be her fault in any way? As someone who works in this field every day, this is sadly far too common.

Her commander blamed Jennifer-Ruth for the assault stating in her Officer Performance Report (OPR) that Jennifer-Ruth \"wandered away from the main party at a Forwarding Operating Base and climbed a guard tower. The Iraqi guard attempted to grope you and then exposed himself to you. It is by luck that you or someone else was not harmed\u2026 .\" Gaslighting and Retaliation It is hard to fathom how one could blame Jennifer-Ruth for the assault, or even have the audacity to accuse her of wandering away from the main party. Jennifer-Ruth was assaulted while on official duties, and while with her partner. Her team was tasked to inspect the construction of a tower. Jennifer-Ruth climbed a ladder up the guard tower with the Iraqi guard, who was also a part of this mission. Jennifer-Ruth\u2019s partner remained at the base of the tower to provide security. Jennifer-Ruth was assaulted by the Iraqi guard when she reached the top of the tower. Jennifer-Ruth came down the tower and immediately reported the assault to her partner. It is unconscionable that her command characterized it in the manner that they did, and that they put it in her OPR. The personal courage that Jennifer-Ruth had to muster while enduring this level of retaliation was unparalleled. Jennifer-Ruth Green, the Republican nominee for Indiana's 1st Congressional District, had her sexual assault weaponized against her.

The men\u2019s team sits atop the English Premier League , with a manager full of ideas and a fearless new generation breaking through into the first team. The atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium is the best it\u2019s ever been and the frustrations that have surrounded the club in recent years seem to be a thing of the past. Arsenal fans expect their club to be challenging for titles and mixing it with the very best teams in the world but that hasn\u2019t been the case following Arsene Wenger\u2019s decision to step down as manager in 2018. The club hasn\u2019t featured in the Champions League since 2017 and has been light-years away from challenging the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City in the Premier League. Its brief membership of the failed European Super League only created further division between the club\u2019s American owners and the fans but, whisper it quietly, Arsenal might be on its way back. \u201cRight now it feels like there\u2019s a big change, a big difference, back to the football that we once loved,\u201d presenter of Arsenal fan channel, AFTV, Cecil Jee Thomas told CNN Sport. \u201cThe way we\u2019re playing and the connection between the club and the fans is the best I\u2019ve seen at the Emirates. \u201cThis is the best start Arsenal have had in many years.

He says the majority of fans are now united behind Spanish manager Mikel Arteta who had previously split opinion, especially after the club finished eighth in his first two years in charge. But a fifth place finish last season showed progression and the team\u2019s development seemingly accelerated over the off-season. It\u2019s won 10 out of its 12 games in the league so far, losing just once to Manchester United. Arteta\u2019s Arsenal now leads Manchester City in the Premier League \u2013 a team that is touted for greatness \u2013 and shows very little signs of slowing down. Arsenal also breezed through Europa League qualification, cementing top spot in the group after a 1-0 win against Zurich on Thursday. \u201cWinning helps winning. The atmosphere in the dressing room is much better after a win than a loss,\u201d Arteta said after the game. Arteta, who was schooled by Pep Guardiola during his time as an assistant at Manchester City, seems to have laid the foundations of the team\u2019s return to the top. The summer signings of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from the Etihad has provided some quality and experience which has blended perfectly with the host of young players coming through Arsenal\u2019s ranks. Academy graduate Bukayo Saka and Brazilian youngster Gabriel Martinelli are busy establishing themselves as top-class Premier League attackers and even the Arsenal defense, something that has long been deemed too soft, looks to have clicked into gear. Despite not scoring in eight games now, Jesus continues to offer so much as a striker. His tenacious pressing and expert hold-up play has helped Arsenal dominate matches and his manager is fully aware of his importance. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change,\u201d Arteta told reporters when asked about the Brazilian\u2019s bad luck in front of goal on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s getting the situations, he\u2019s getting the chances, he\u2019s contributing to the team an awful lot, he\u2019s helping to win matches, the way he competes for every ball in every single action is incredible. \u201cIt will come, he needs to be patient, he\u2019s been through that in the past and he needs to learn those lessons and don\u2019t stop doing those other things that he\u2019s doing so well, because that\u2019s going to maintain the level of him and the team.\u201d Fans have enjoyed watching Arsenal\u2019s rebuilding process and have been able to do so more closely than ever before. The club\u2019s Amazon \u2018All or Nothing\u2019 series was released at the start of the season and documented Arsenal\u2019s previous campaign. It included behind-the-scenes footage of training, the changing room and meetings between the club\u2019s hierarchy. The series allowed fans to see the human side of players who have recently been on the receiving end of a lot of criticism \u2013 none more so than Granit Xhaka. The midfielder\u2019s time at the club looking to be over in 2019 after he reacted angrily to boos from the crowd after being subbed off. He took his shirt off, swore at the Arsenal fans and stormed down the tunnel in what looked to be his last act as a player for the club. But two seasons later and the midfield general is one of Arteta\u2019s most important and consistent performers. The decision to give Xhaka another chance was yet another big call that Arteta got right. The Amazon series did, however, highlight some novel ways in which Arteta looked to motivate his team \u2013 from the use of drawings to playing Liverpool\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d anthem during training before the game. \u201cI think before it came out, a lot of fans were worried to see what it was going to be, whether it would be something to be laughed at,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut I think it depicted Arsenal in such a great way, the way Arteta is with his players and how much he puts emphasis on trying to build the relationship between the fans and the team.\u201d AFTV has continued to grow as a channel, though it has sometimes drawn criticism for being too negative about the team. But it now seems the club\u2019s leadership team is determined to rebuild the relationship with its fans, especially after the protests around the proposed European Super League. Technical director Edu, a former player at the club who is now responsible for player recruitment, appears to be leading that charge and has also been praised for helping to create an identity around this current team that fans have been able to connect with. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they realized how powerful the fans were,\u201d Thomas said. The club\u2019s subsequent hard work has reaped rewards and Arteta has been able to create a warmth around the club, demonstrating the potential reward for owners who stick by their manager through tough times. The unity is perhaps best demonstrated by the new anthem \u2018North London Forever\u2019 which is sung at the Emirates Stadium before every home game. \u201cArteta addresses the fans in his press conferences as well and he says how important we are,\u201d Thomas added, saying some fans have even begun tentatively warming to the club\u2019s owners, the Kroenke family. \u201cThe unity that we have is so different and it\u2019s so lovely to be a part of. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m really appreciating. \u201cFans were saying the owners weren\u2019t connected to us and this is all about business and money, but now they [owners] seem to play a bit more of a part when it comes to the success of this club.\u201d In truth, there have been multiple false dawns at Arsenal since it last won a league title in 2004 and Thomas says fans aren\u2019t getting carried away just yet. Squad depth in certain positions is still not what many would hope for. Jesus, for example, has been a revelation upfront but should he get injured, there isn\u2019t a replacement at the same level. The realistic expectation, then, is not necessarily to win the Premier League title but to cement itself back in the Champions League. \u201cRight now we are sitting top of the Premier League and we are in a conversation for the title but I think the expectation is top four,\u201d Thomas concedes. \u2018If you get a second, you still get Champions League football. If you get fourth, you still get Champions League football \u2013 you don\u2019t get a trophy for either of those positions. \u201cSo for me and for many others, top four is definitely the expectation and if we get a trophy on top of that, for me that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d Given the momentum at the club as of late, the World Cup in Qatar could not have come at a worse time. The Premier League will pause for over a month as many of Arsenal\u2019s players will travel to the Gulf nation to join their respective teams. It\u2019s impact on the season is somewhat of a unknown quantity but fans will be hope the team can continue its good form going into the break.

Miller was also accused of calling 14-year-old Meyer-Crothers \u201cbrownie\u201d and the \u201cN-word\u201d while repeatedly beating him during their childhood in Toledo, Ohio, according to the Arizona Republic . Bruins General Manager Cam Neely released a statement about Miller\u2019s signing. \u201cRepresenting the Boston Bruins is a privilege we take seriously as an organization,\u201d Neely said. \u201cMitchell was accountable for his unacceptable behavior and demonstrated his commitment to work with multiple organizations and professionals to further his education and use his mistake as a teachable moment for others.\u201d Mitchell said in the same statement released by the Bruins he would continue to educate himself and share his mistakes with others while playing for the organization. Originally drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in 2020, Miller has yet to play in the NHL. The team cut ties with Miller weeks later, along with The University of North Dakota, where the young defenseman played college hockey after scrutiny from the public and media. Miller spent the past two seasons in the USHL before he signed with the Bruins. The team reportedly evaluated Miller for several weeks.

The Pennsylvania native pointed particularly to his home state, where Dr. Mehmet Oz is facing Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. Gingrich , who grew up near Harrisburg, predicted Oz will defeat the Democrat and hold an otherwise politically-tenuous Republican seat vacated by Lehigh County's Pat Toomey.

Hemmer said the magnitude \u2013 if any \u2013 by which Republicans would have a productive night might be determined by how three key races turn out. House January 6 Committee member Elaine Luria is facing Jennifer Kiggans in Norfolk and Cape Charles, which Hemmer said is essentially a swing district that the Republican could win. If Kiggans and Spotsylvania-area Republican hopeful Yesli Vega defeats moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, it could portend an even more intense GOP win overall. And if Navy veteran Hung Cao is able to defeat Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., in Loudoun and Fairfax Counties, the question may not be if there would be a Republican surge, but how much of one, Hemmer said. He added that, in the House, surprising states like Connecticut and Rhode Island could see Republicans being competitive. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

It\u2019s a classic battle of opposites as Tennessee comes in with the top offense in the country and Georgia will counter with a defense that's second in the nation in points allowed per game (10.5).

Smith, a potential first-round NFL Draft pick, leads the Bulldogs with three sacks, seven tackles for loss and and 16 quarterback hurries. But it\u2019s a defense that is loaded with talent, fourth in the country in yards allowed per game (262.6) and 13th in the country in passing yards (177.1).

SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea added to its recent barrage of weapons demonstrations by launching four ballistic missiles into the sea on Saturday, as the United States sent two supersonic bombers streaking over South Korea in a dueling display of military might that underscored rising tensions in the region. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the four short-range missiles fired from a western coastal area around noon flew about 130 kilometers (80 miles) toward the country's western sea. The North has test-fired more than 30 missiles this week, including an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday that triggered evacuation alerts in northern Japan, and flew large numbers of warplanes inside its territory in an angry reaction to a massive combined aerial exercise between the United States and South Korea. The South Korean military said two B-1B bombers trained with four U.S. F-16 fighter jets and four South Korean F-35s jets during the last day of the \"Vigilant Storm\" joint air force drills that wraps up Saturday. It marked the first time since December 2017 that the bombers were deployed to the Korean Peninsula. The exercise involved around 240 warplanes, including advanced F-35 fighter jets from both countries. North Korea's Foreign Ministry late Friday described the country's military actions this week as an appropriate response to the exercise, which it called a display of U.S. \"military confrontation hysteria.\" It said North Korea will respond with the \"toughest counteraction\" to any attempts by \"hostile forces\" to infringe on its sovereignty or security interests. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the participation of the B-1Bs in the joint drills demonstrated the allies' readiness to \"sternly respond\" to North Korean provocations and the U.S. commitment to defend its ally with the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear. B-1B flyovers had been a familiar show of force during past periods of tensions with North Korea. The planes last appeared in the region in 2017, during another provocative run in North Korean weapons demonstrations. But the flyovers had been halted in recent years as the United States and South Korea stopped their large-scale exercises to support the former Trump administration's diplomatic efforts with North Korea and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allies resumed their large-scale training this year after North Korea dialed up its weapons testing to a record pace, exploiting a divide in the U.N. Security Council over Russia's war on Ukraine as a window to accelerate arms development. North Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range. The North has continued to describe the B-1B as a \"nuclear strategic bomber\" although the plane was switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s. Vigilant Storm had been initially scheduled to end Friday, but the allies decided to extend the training to Saturday in response to a series of North Korean ballistic launches on Thursday, including an ICBM that triggered evacuation alerts and halted trains in northern Japan. Thursday's launches came after the North fired more than 20 missiles on Wednesday, the most in a single day. Those launches came after North Korean senior military official Pak Jong Chon issued a veiled threat of a nuclear conflict with the United States and South Korea over their joint drills, which the North says are rehearsals for a potential invasion. South Korea also on Friday scrambled about 80 military aircraft after tracking about 180 flights by North Korean warplanes inside North Korean territory. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean warplanes were detected in various areas inland and along the country's eastern and western coasts, but did not come particularly close to the Koreas' border. The South Korean military spotted about 180 flight trails from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., but it wasn't immediately clear how many North Korean planes were involved and whether some may have flown more than once. In Friday's statement attributed to an unidentified spokesperson, North Korea's Foreign Ministry said the United States and South Korea had created a seriously \"unstable atmosphere\" in the region with their military exercises. It accused the United States of mobilizing its allies in a campaign using sanctions and military threats to pressure North Korea to unilaterally disarm. \"The sustained provocation is bound to be followed by sustained counteraction,\" the statement said. North Korea has launched dozens of ballistic missiles this year, including multiple ICBMs and an intermediate-range missile flown over Japan. South Korean officials say there are indications North Korea in coming weeks could detonate its first nuclear test device since 2017.

But before the 1970s, clumsy, haphazard care, often at the hands of police officers, was the norm for emergencies. So much so that negligent ambulance care was responsible for an estimated 1,200 to 2,000 preventable deaths per year in the United States, according to journalist and former paramedic Kevin Hazzard. In his new book American Sirens , Hazzard narrates the eight-year saga of the Freedom House Ambulance Service, the all-Black team of paramedics who pioneered the profession from 1968-1975 in Pittsburgh. The book documents an untold piece of American history, recording how Freedom House saved thousands of lives and influenced the emergence of professional paramedic services in cities across the U.S., eventually setting the gold standard of emergency medical care. Hazzard begins the book through the eyes of John Moon, a Black man who was born into poverty at Atlanta's Grady Hospital but found his calling as a Freedom House recruit. Other prominent Freedom House contributors include Dr. Peter Safar , the Austrian-born physician who co-founded Freedom House Ambulance Service shortly after he invented mouth-to-mouth resuscitation; and Dr. Nancy Caroline , the first medical director of Freedom House who authored the seminal emergency medical services text Emergency Care in the Streets. With his professional EMS experience, Hazzard's writing feels like a paramedic ride-along, witnessing medical chaos \u2013 intubating patients against the clock, confronting frightened patients and their distressed relatives, and competing with an adversarial police force. Most shocking are the stories of preventable deaths before the advent of EMS, illustrating the crater-wide gap the Freedom House service filled. Wealthy, white Pittsburgh residents could afford private ambulances, while residents of the Hill District, the city's oldest Black neighborhood, barely received basic city services, let alone a chance for survival in a medical emergency. Paramedics Eugene Key and Harold Brown demonstrate their equipment for a guest in 1975. The National EMS Museum Archives hide caption Freedom House provided much needed medical care in a neglected community. It also provided employment and training opportunities for dignified work. Some members of the team were high school dropouts, none had formal medical training whatsoever. They became skilled paramedics and dispatchers saving lives. By 1972, Freedom House employed 35 crew members, received 7,000 calls a year, and its leaders had established the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians to formalize the field. The crew pioneered several medical developments and technologies, including the introduction of medical physicians to ambulance work, allowing medics to transmit EKGs, using air casts to stabilize injured bones and joints, and even administering Narcan to overdose patients. NPR spoke with Hazzard about the book, the racism the predominantly Black team faced, and how the Freedom House Ambulance Service changed U.S. society for the better. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. The EMS workforce today is majority white and male, with the proportion of Black paramedics around 8% . Meanwhile, most people do not know that this profession has roots in a Black neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Why is it important that this story is told? I had written this memoir about my time as a paramedic, and somebody sent me an email and said, 'Hey, you know, have you ever heard this other story?' I realized that not only I had not heard the story, but nobody had. I found it strange that I had been taught by people who began their EMS careers in the 1970s \u2013 very close to the genesis of the field \u2013 and yet, none of them had ever said anything about this. So once I came across the story, I thought that this was the history of something that had a profound effect on my life and I want to tell this story. When I started digging into it, I immediately realized by talking to the men and women involved that some people died waiting for this story to be told, and others were waiting for the world to simply acknowledge this incredible thing they did and the service they provided to all of us. American Sirens, a book by Kevin Hazzard, traces the history of the professional ambulance service in the U.S. Hachette Books hide caption American Sirens, a book by Kevin Hazzard, traces the history of the professional ambulance service in the U.S. What was it like to sit down with these people who were so formative in your training as a paramedic, and hear their stories? It is not very often, you have an opportunity to reach out and touch history. [I spoke with] the surviving members of Freedom House \u2014 the doctors are gone, a huge portion of the paramedics themselves are gone, but some of them are still there. This was not a small achievement. This was a massive, massive thing they did. They all say I was just doing a job, but they knew that they were changing the world. That's why it meant so much to them. Freedom House changed forever how the ambulance industry works, down to the color of the ambulance, the way that the ambulance was designed, many of the pieces of equipment that we used and the textbook. A lot of people know Nancy Caroline and that she wrote Emergency Care in the Streets . It's this sort of Bible for EMS, but where did that information come from? How did she test those ideas and those theories? Where did those lessons come from? They came from the couple dozen people [at Freedom House]. On April 4th, 1968, they began work that influenced what people did four decades later and that is a tremendous legacy. The stamp that they left on the field of EMS, it simply cannot be underestimated. There's too many innovations that were born out of Freedom House Ambulance Service. The razing of entire Black and Latinx communities in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and New York City to \"revitalize\" cities in the 1960s sets the backdrop for Freedom House's emergence. Why did you need to include urban renewal in this story about the first paramedics? On its surface, urban renewal was a good thing. Yet, what nobody wants to acknowledge is that to do this thing, to build these universities and hospital systems and put in highways, somebody had to lose. That's not a very flattering story to tell. I was born in '77, so much of this took place before I was born. We tend to say, well, these things a long time ago, and we've moved on from that. [But] the insidious nature of this sort of systemized disenfranchisement of an entire group, I felt was important to tell. Without it there's no way to understand who these 24 people were, how unlikely it was that this situation would come about, how important it is that they are the ones to do it first, and how unsurprising it was that they had all this pushback. At one point, Pittsburgh's mayor at the time, Robert Flaherty, pushed to get Freedom House defunded, discredited, and shut down. He and others considered the services that Freedom House provided to be \"un-American.\" What about providing emergency medical service and saving lives garnered this label? The un-American thing was idea of public money being used for what people viewed as a business. There were private companies who felt that getting city money was perhaps unconstitutional. The other question that came up was if we are going to say that an ambulance is a public service that needs to be paid for with public dollars, what happens to the rest of medicine? A common boogeyman of the right is this idea of socialized medicine, and suddenly, it becomes a slippery slope where everything is public. I found that staggering that people are so afraid of a public health system that they would try to handicap even an emergency system. What are some of the challenges that today's paramedics face that are parallel to that of Freedom House faced in the 1970s? In so many ways, many things haven't changed at all. You know, I think the last two and a half years have shown that we are unable to learn from our mistakes and plan ahead. So, people on an ambulance today are fighting for money. They're fighting for benefits. How many years did it take firefighters from New York to get benefits for 9/11-related health problems? Here in Georgia, the firefighters have been fighting to get various types of on-the-job cancer coverage because that was something they didn't have. And they're the only people other than doctors who can intubate, for instance.

Many took the detour. Odd Andersen/Associated Press hide caption In an experiment conducted by researchers at Queen Mary University of London, bees could make their way through an unobstructed path to a feeding area or opt for a detour into a chamber with wooden balls (toys). Many took the detour. When put to the test, bees have proved over and over again that they've got a lot more to offer than pollinating, making honey and being fiercely loyal to a queen. The industrious insects can count and alter their behavior when things seem difficult , and now some scientists say there's proof they also like to play. A study recently published in Animal Behavior suggests that bumblebees, when given the chance, like to fool around with toys. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London conducted an experiment in which they set up a container that allowed bees to travel from their nest to a feeding area. But along the way, the bees could opt to pass through a separate section with a smattering of small wooden balls. Over 18 days, the scientists watched as the bees \"went out of their way to roll wooden balls repeatedly, despite no apparent incentive to do so.\" The finding suggests that like humans, insects also interact with inanimate objects as a form of play. Also similar to people, younger bees seemed to be more playful than adult bees. In this experiment from researchers at Queen Mary University of London, bumblebees, especially young ones, appeared to show they liked to cling to wooden balls twice their size and roll them around just for the fun of it. \"This research provides a strong indication that insect minds are far more sophisticated than we might imagine,\" Lars Chittka, a professor of sensory and behavioral ecology at Queen Mary University of London, who led the study, said in a statement . Earlier studies have shown that the black and yellow bugs are willing to learn new tricks in exchange for food or other rewards, so in this case Chittka and his team set out to create conditions that would eliminate external variables. They made sure that the bees had acclimated to their new home and that their environment was stress free. In one experiment, the bees, which were tracked by age and sex, could make their way through an unobstructed path to a feeding area or opt for a detour into a chamber with the wooden balls. Many took the detour. Video shows the chubby insects clinging to balls (about twice the size of the bees) and maneuvering them around. In more comical moments, some bees appeared to do somersaults while holding on. Other times they would walk in reverse, pulling the ball with them \u2014 an unnatural movement for bumblebees. \"There are lots of animals who play just for the purposes of enjoyment, but most examples come from young mammals and birds,\" said Chittka. The study's first author, Samadi Galpayage, who is a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, added that it is yet more evidence that insects may be capable of experiencing feelings. \"They may actually experience some kind of positive emotional states, even if rudimentary, like other larger fluffy, or not so fluffy, animals do.

ISTANBUL \u2014 Since early August, more than 10 million metric tons of Ukrainian grain have been exported, most of it wheat and corn, through a humanitarian corridor set up in the Black Sea. The agreement that allows Ukraine to export grain has been a lifeline for Ukraine's crippled economy and has helped countries that were experiencing severe food shortages due to the war. It has also helped stabilize global food prices. Shipments had essentially been blocked since the start of the war by the Russian navy. The United Nations and Turkey had to press for Ukraine and Russia to set up a system for letting ships through. The August deal hinged on parties agreeing to a complex maritime inspection routine, with international teams boarding ships to make sure they're not sneaking weapons, stowaways or exports of other items not in the agreement. Last weekend, Moscow announced it would stop participating in the deal after an attack on its Black Sea fleet, immediately leading to concerns about global food security. But Russia reversed its decision after it secured written assurance from Ukraine that the shipping corridors would not be used for military purposes. NPR was allowed recently to go to the Sea of Marmara with inspectors from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the U.N. to observe how the inspections work.

And new vessels \u2014 those not already scheduled \u2014 were unable to go to Ukraine to pick up exports, leading to a small lag in operations. The current agreement expires on Nov. 19.

Here comes the end of Daylight Saving for 2022, a Sunday morning most of us enjoy because we get an extra hour to sleep in. Catching up on sleep each November, however, is the only good thing that comes with Daylight Saving or DST (it\u2019s singular, not plural, by the way).

Your body hates to shift an hour either forward or back. It\u2019s like getting jet lag even though you didn\u2019t even get to travel anywhere.

And we all know how that worked out. Video Why keep DST? Some studies indicate that it saves a small amount of energy, because we do more stuff on summer evenings than summer mornings. Of course, now you need more energy in winter mornings, when it\u2019s darker longer, so there goes that argument. Some say that fewer pedestrians are killed because the days are longer. In fact, more pedestrians and bicyclists are hit by cars because of DST, simply because more of them are outside when the evenings are longer. So, the time has come to eliminate Daylight Saving, once and for all. Election day is Tuesday, and new Congress will be sworn in come January. Here\u2019s a bit of bipartisanship that can get the new session off on the right foot: eliminate DST now and forever.

It\u2019s an uneven, uninspiring season of television that fails to live up to the high standard of past seasons, while also tearing into royals\u2019 worst public and private moments. If The Crown \u2018s early seasons were a sophisticated soap opera that invited empathy for Elizabeth II and her brood, The Crown Season 5 depicts the same characters as petty, selfish, and stupid relics of a bygone era. Even in the season\u2019s more triumphant moments, creator Peter Morgan can\u2019t help but to push the question: Are the royals obsolete? And the answer The Crown Season 5 repeatedly hammers home is yes . The Crown Season 5 begins with a cold open featuring our original Elizabeth II , Claire Foy , in all her youthful glamorous glory and then cuts to Imelda Staunton \u2018s 1990s version of the Queen. We meet Elizabeth II mid-physical, where she\u2019s first told to say, \u201cAhhh,\u201d and then informed that she\u2019s gained weight. The rest of the episode \u2014 and indeed the season \u2014 is obsessed with the idea that the once vigorous Lilibet is old and stale now. As is the monarchy. The monarchy\u2019s expiration date is something of an obsession for Elizabeth\u2019s eldest son and heir, Prince Charles (Dominic West, who replaces Josh O\u2019Connor). While tensions remain frosty between Charles and wife Diana (Elizabeth Debicki, who replaces Emma Corrin), the two seem to have settled into a temporary ceasefire that is doomed to erupt into total warfare. In the season opener, the new Conservative Prime Minister John Major (Johnny Lee Miller) vents to his wife that the U.K.\u2019s greatest crisis might not be war or recession, but the oncoming implosion of the royals. From there, we get a season that largely fails in its attempt to showcase the most lurid tales of this era with some semblance of compassion. We get such \u201chits\u201d of the era as Charles\u2019s Tampongate, Fergie\u2019s toes getting sucked on a beach, an aging Prince Philip\u2019s (Jonathan Pryce) \u201cfriendship\u201d with Penelope Knatchbull (Natascha McElhone), and the scandalous way Martin Bashir (Prasanna Puwanarajah) cornered Di into her explosive Panorama interview. Unfortunately, writer and creator Peter Morgan struggles to find the balance between classy and trashy that defined earlier seasons. At times, The Crown Season 5 even veers into Lifetime movie territory. We get a glimpse of Diana\u2019s secret romance with heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan (Humayun Saeed), but their courtship lacks chemistry. In other areas, the storyline is downright cringeworthy. While I know Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed (Salim Daw) did employ the deceased Duke of Windsor\u2019s Black equerry Sydney Johnson (Jude Akuwudike) to teach him British etiquette, there\u2019s something queasy about The Crown centering an entire episode on BIPOC characters slavishly stuck in the royals\u2019 thrall. It\u2019s not all disastrous, though; there are some excellent things about this season, too. Namely, Lesley Manville\u2019s Princess Margaret is an extremely worthy successor to Vanessa Kirby and Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s versions of Elizabeth\u2019s glittering younger sister. Jonny Lee Miller will have you rooting for John Major regardless of your place on the political spectrum. And watching young Prince William (Senan West) wrestle with his disappointment in his mother Diana was devastating to behold. As always, the set design, costumes, direction, score, and other technical elements are sublime. The Crown Season 5 is watchable, for sure. But it wobbles where past seasons dazzled. Key members of the new ensemble cast feel like downgrades from the Emmy-winning stars of seasons past. Imelda Staunton is fine as Queen Elizabeth II, but not as steely as Foy or layered as Olivia Colman. In fact, her Lilibet kind of comes across as a dud. But the bigger casting blunders in The Crown Season 5 are Charles and Diana. Dominic West tries hard, but he\u2019s woefully miscast as the aging aristocrat. He doesn\u2019t even attempt to embrace Charles\u2019s historically balding hairstyle. (Charles has never had that thick head of hair, Netflix!) Elizabeth Debicki, on the other hand, sure looks and sounds the part, but her excavation of Diana barely scratches the surface. At best, you could say that Debicki\u2019s Diana haunts the show like a living ghost. Her doom is perpetually foreshadowed, while her whole self never fully materializes. Josh O\u2019Connor and Emma Corrin were able to channel the Charles and Di the public loved while also introducing us to the tormented people behind the headlines. O\u2019Connor deftly embraced Charles\u2019s dork factor and used it to humanize the Prince of Wales. Corrin\u2019s Diana always maintained a halo of innocence, even when the show delighted in illustrating her Machiavellian seduction of first the royals and then the public. West\u2019s refusal to shed his own hunk status robs Charles of the sympathy O\u2019Connor rallied for the character and Debicki struggles to contain the contradictions of Princess Di like Corrin did. The Crown has always loved a metaphor, but Season 5 takes each and every nod towards symbolism way too far. If characters aren\u2019t explicitly explaining the metaphor out loud, then a scholar at Eton is underlining the whole theme of an episode on a chalkboard for us to read. Which is ironic, though, because the most interesting thing about The Crown Season 5 is how it feels like the perfect parallel to King Charles III\u2019s already dramatic reign. While Elizabeth II was still alive, Netflix\u2019s flagship show \u2014 just like Merry Old England itself \u2014 felt consistently steady. However, now that the real QEII is gone, The Crown Season 5 feels just as adrift as Dear Old Blighty is IRL. Do we still need a British royal family? Are the current senior royals worthy of the task? And, if not, is the tawdry soap opera of their lives enough to keep us entertained and them on their gilded thrones? The Crown is still figuring that out.

I asked what they were mad about and what the discussion was about that upset them, but they didn\u2019t say \u2014 they just quit contacting her. To me, it\u2019s childish and rude to treat their sister that way. Do you have any thoughts or suggestions? \u2014 DID NOT KNOW IN THE SOUTH DEAR DID NOT: Yes, I do. The term for what your wife\u2019s brothers have been doing is \u201cpassive aggression.\u201d Because your wife\u2019s brothers aren\u2019t willing to address the issue, nothing can be done to resolve it.

DEAR ABBY: We have a group of friends who get together most Friday nights. We go out to eat, meet for drinks or gather at one of the group member\u2019s homes for dinner and drinks. One person in particular constantly complains about everything every single week. They don\u2019t like the restaurant that was chosen, or the food the host prepared or the place the pizza was ordered from. Once, they kept repeatedly telling the host they wanted to punch the host\u2019s son in the face because he was rude to the host on his way out for the evening. This guest\u2019s spouse also nitpicks relentlessly. It makes everybody uncomfortable. It has reached the point that the group doesn\u2019t want to get together anymore because of the damper this couple puts on the evening. My spouse and I haven\u2019t seen the group for several weeks now, but we miss them. Is there a polite way to tell this couple their negativity is a drag on the rest of the group, and maybe they should seek professional help or learn to keep their mouths shut? \u2014 DOWN WITH THE DOWNER DEAR DOWN: No, there isn\u2019t. But you could stop inviting this particular couple. If you are asked about it, all you have to say is that you grew tired of their constant criticism, which put a damper on the events. DEAR ABBY: My daughter is married with two children and, so far, she\u2019s happy with a wonderful husband and a beautiful home. My concern \u2014 or curiosity \u2014 is that they have hung professionally done photos of themselves, their kids, their friends and candid images from their wedding in many of the rooms on the first floor, but there are none of my husband and me or the other grandparents. Every Christmas we receive another framed family photo of them. What would you think if we gifted them a lovely portrait of us? \u2014 UNSEEN IN MINNESOTA DEAR UNSEEN: I think it\u2019s worth a try, but don\u2019t be offended if they don\u2019t display it.

National Geographic released its annual \u201cBest of the World\u201d list last week, which features what it calls must-see locations worldwide. List curator and National Geographic senior editor Amy Alipio told Fox News Digital that the picks for each year are determined in collaboration with explorers, writers and editorial teams all over the world. After 11 years of compiling the annual travel list, Alipio revealed that she and her team are \u201calways looking for an interesting mix.\u201d \u201cWe want to get people interested in other places that they might not have heard about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding places where you\u2019re surprised \u2014 and I feel like when you\u2019re surprised and kind of in awe of a place, it generates empathy and a desire to protect that destination.\u201d Here\u2019s why National Geographic included Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; San Francisco, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and the state of Utah in the mix. Big Bend National Park of Far West Texas made an appearance on NatGeo\u2019s list in its nature category. Although it\u2019s one of the least visited national parks, according to Alipio, Big Bend has stunning views and wildlife features just as other popular outdoor destinations do. \u201cOne of the reasons why we love that it was on the list this year was that because with a lot of the overcrowding that\u2019s going on at some national parks \u2014 like, for example, Yellowstone \u2014 Big Bend gets a fraction of the visitors that Yellowstone does,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it has landscapes that are just as amazing.\u201d Big Bend National Park sits at the border of Texas and Mexico, showing off its desert landscape and picturesque rivers. The national park also has several \u201cinteresting\u201d towns around it, including Marathon, Alpine and Marfa, said Alipio. The towns emulate an early-frontier Texan feel with small, locally owned shops and wide-open spaces. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re in a movie,\u201d Alipio said. Wisconsin\u2019s lake-side city of Milwaukee was mentioned in the list as NatGeo introduces a new community category. The destinations listed under community are highlighted for giving back to locals through tourism. Alipio pointed out that Milwaukee is so much more than its stereotype of \u201cbreweries and bratwurst.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lively city that supports its creative community,\u201d she said. Milwaukee has recently reclaimed vacant lots to rebuild its entertainment district, also known as Deer District. The city also plans to open a new African American art and cultural center in the revived traditional neighborhood of Bronzeville. \u201cThere\u2019s always a place on the list that kind of makes you go, \u2018Who knew about this place?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here \u2014 Milwaukee \u2014 we have it as this Great Lake city to watch.\u201d The entire state of Utah was noted as a place to visit for maximum adventure. The western state is known for its variety of outdoor excursions, from paddleboarding to mountain climbing , and its overall gorgeous landscape. NatGeo\u2019s list encouraged readers to get their \u201cadrenaline rush\u201d in the less visited areas of Utah. While visitors seek out popular Utah stops such as Zion National Park, Alidio said the state is working to override issues of overcrowding by building out the park\u2019s east side entry and opening a visitors\u2019 center. \u201cIt\u2019s just as beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re promoting other areas of the state as well where you can have just as amazing adventure experiences.\u201d The east side of Zion is often known as the quiet side, according to VisitUtah.com, with closer access to other sites like Bryce Canyon National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim. Charleston is well-known for its southern charm. NatGeo added the South Carolina city to its list under the culture category, noting the thrill of exploring Charleston\u2019s low country cuisine and cultural history . \u201cWe all love Charleston for its food and architecture and its setting there in South Carolina,\u201d Alipio said. But Charleston is also highlighted now for acknowledging the city\u2019s \u201cless than ideal\u201d history in slave trade, Alipio mentioned. Charleston\u2019s International African American Museum is slated to open in January 2023. \u201cThere are lots of stories there of tragedy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, stories of triumph as well.\u201d The city is also home to a genealogical center where people can research family history and heritage. Historians believe that nearly 90% of Black Americans can trace an ancestor back to Charleston, according to Alipio. \u201cThis is a really important place in American history, and we wanted to shine a light on this destination for that reason.\u201d San Francisco\u2019s Crosstown Trail made an appearance on the list for being family-oriented. Even though San Francisco is already a popular spot, Alipio shared that the city has re-imagined its outdoor spaces . The city\u2019s new Crosstown Trail cuts diagonally across San Francisco, which allows families to hike, bike and enjoy nature right at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go out really remote or have special gear to go hiking,\u201d she said. \u201cAn urban trail is right there as close as your neighborhood basketball court.\u201d San Francisco also opened the Presidio Tunnel Tops this past summer, which were built on top of former freeway tunnels on the bay within Presidio National Park. The new attraction offers a stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as a nature center, playgrounds, food trucks and sites to start a campfire. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really fun place,\u201d she said.

They\u2019d better keep their boxing gloves laced tightly for the next five months.", "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Even though mediocre teams are never supposed to win on the road against superior opponents, the Knicks had absolutely no choice but to win Friday. They were not exactly facing the Julius Erving-Moses Malone 76ers. In fact, they weren\u2019t even facing the Joel Embiid-James Harden 76ers. With Philadelphia\u2019s two franchise players out, and with the deep, rough-and-tumble Eastern Conference offering no free passes, the Knicks needed to prove to themselves \u2014 and to everyone else \u2014 that they could at least sink a five-foot uphill putt after it had been practically conceded. They did not hit that putt dead center. No, it did a 360 spin around the cup before falling at last, leaving the visitors at Wells Fargo Center looking more relieved than joyful at the final horn Friday night. No surprise there. As a rule, nothing will come easily to this middling group. These are the Knicks after all, and after seven games the best thing that could be said about them is that they aren\u2019t the Nets, and that maybe it isn\u2019t such a horrible thing in the end that they failed to sign Kyrie Irving (with Kevin Durant) in the summer of 2019. (The Knicks offered an apology to their fan base after that failure. Yes, that can be retracted now.) But this eighth game, a 106-104 victory over Philly , might\u2019ve done a lot more than get the Knicks back to .500. They were down 12 points early in the fourth quarter, and they didn\u2019t have a clue how to cover Tyrese Maxey, the emerging star who scored 27 points in the first 36 minutes. While watching Immanuel Quickley\u2019s college teammate repeatedly blow by a parade of overmatched defenders, it was hard not to think that the Knicks ended up with the wrong Kentucky guard in the 2020 draft. What else is new, right? This was looking like another night to whine in print about the Knicks\u2019 lack of a true superstar, their inability to trade for Donovan Mitchell or Dejounte Murray, and the fact that Mitchell, Murray, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Ja Morant \u2014 the four men most responsible for the Knicks\u2019 four early defeats \u2014 had combined for 138 points and 39 assists in those games, delivering performances that you won\u2019t be seeing on Tom Thibodeau\u2019s side of the box score. Only it didn\u2019t play out like that. Thibodeau\u2019s decision to start Quentin Grimes turned out to be a non-factor as Grimes scored two points and was minus-20 in 15 minutes. The Knicks committed 13 turnovers before 14 minutes of basketball had been played, they squandered a five-point halftime lead with a dreadful third quarter after Mitchell Robinson left the game with a bum knee, but then they overcame it all. \u201cWe fought,\u201d RJ Barrett said. \u201cIt was beautiful to see.\u201d Yes, an ugly game can indeed be a beautiful thing. Obi Toppin was making plays all over the floor \u2014 and making a persuasive case for the Toppin-Julius Randle pairing that keeps Thibs up at night \u2014 while Jalen Brunson was giving some locals in the crowd a reminder of what he did for Villanova, slicing down the lane for a basket, a drawn foul, and a three-point play with 1:05 left that was one of the biggest sequences of the night. Asked beforehand what Brunson has brought to his new team, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said: \u201cLeadership. Toughness. Big shot maker. Winner. Other than that \u2026 [laughter]. No, really, I think all those things are what he\u2019s good at. I don\u2019t think you look at him and see one thing that stands out, other than all the intangibles that make him a really good player.\u201d Brunson led the Knicks with 23 points and seven assists against only one turnover. He is not much to look at athletically, but he is too smart and efficient with the ball for that to matter. \u201cWe were very resilient,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of opportunities in other games. We\u2019ve been up and we\u2019ve been down and we came up short the last couple of those. But we finally did enough to win.\u201d That was the best part of the whole thing. Even with the addition of Brunson, the Knicks don\u2019t have a lot of talent. They have a number of good players, but no great ones. If they want any shot of making the real playoffs, and staying out of the play-in tournament, they need to show consistent competitive heart from here until springtime. \u201cTo me, you need that in everything in life,\u201d said Barrett, who scored 22 points. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to compete in everything to just try to do the best. We\u2019ll definitely need that throughout the season.\u201d The Knicks don\u2019t have an anchor. They don\u2019t have a face of the franchise, and their hope that Barrett will grow into one is a 50-50 proposition at best. They have to do all of the little things to compensate for the dearth of big names capable of doing the big things. Thibodeau put it this way: \u201cWe\u2019re asking everyone to sacrifice and put the team first. If we do that, we have a chance.\u201d The Knicks fought for their chance to win on Friday night.

(The Jets, in fairness, have done their share of that, too, but the Jets have the Bills this weekend and, let\u2019s face it, by 4 o\u2019clock or so Sunday we may REALLY see what a team in need of a bye week looks like.) The last month has been a bit of a firestorm around here, maybe you\u2019ve noticed. The Mets and the Yankees ended seasons of intense promise and hope in the throes of bitter disappointment, and their fans have been force-fed an Astros-Phillies World Series straight out of the third circle of Hell . The Knicks have lately looked like a duplicate copy from any of the disappointing seasons out of the last 22 or so. The Nets? Yeah. The Nets have been the anti-Giants, underachieving and all but daring their fans to stay interested while they merrily pour kerosene on the team logo day after day after day after day. But the Giants have been different. Oh, the Devils and Islanders are both on nice winning streaks now, and the Rangers are talented enough that they\u2019ll pile up plenty of points, but hockey season is still in its infancy. As Charles Barley once famously said: \u201cEarly in the season, teams that suck don\u2019t know that they suck yet.\u201d But this is eight games with the Giants \u2014 traditionally the midway point of an NFL season, and even in a 17-game schedule still far enough along to not be suckered in by small sample sizes. The Giants are 6-2. Better, they are the best kind of 6-2: few of their fans saw this coming, little was expected of them, and yet they\u2019ve overperformed and overdelivered with a roster stuffed with players who are difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to dislike. And now, they have paused. Good for them. Not so much for the rest of us. \u201cAt this point in time during the season, I think everyone\u2019s tired, coaching-wise. Everybody\u2019s sore, playing-wise,\u201d Giants head coach Brian Daboll said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s just the nature of this league, and you just keep on pushing through. I think you need to try to take advantage of a little bit of downtime to recuperate, to get some rest and to come back fresh and ready to go for us this last half of the season where we have our bye.\u201d Soon enough, the teeth of the season will be upon them and we will see with clear eyes how good the Giants really are. But first there will be home games against Houston and Detroit, and a genuine opportunity to be 8-2 before the schedule gets a tad meaner. It is one of the more endearing characteristics of this team so far that while we\u2019re allowed to speculate about what\u2019s to come, they have all bought into living in the moment, and understanding there\u2019s more to getting where they\u2019ve gotten than sheer happenstance. \u201cI think we\u2019re all excited,\u201d quarterback Daniel Jones said earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun to win, it\u2019s been fun to play well, and pull out some of these games down the stretch. We appreciate the position we\u2019re in, we\u2019re enjoying that but there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d There is, and it will be fun to see how that work pays off, and where things will shake out the next time the Giants earn a breather. That\u2019ll either be the end of the season or \u2014 if things are really destined to follow a storybook path \u2014 the week after the season ends, with a bye earned as the No. 1 seed in the East. No, that isn\u2019t likely and, no, it\u2019s probably not feasible. But nine weeks ago, would 6-2 seemed likely?

The Blazers had just 1 second left when Justise Winslow lofted a high in-bounds pass to Grant, who grabbed the ball and tossed a high-arching 13-foot jumper in the air. It rattled through the net and after a review, the officials confirmed it left his hands in time. Grant\u2019s clutch shot capped a back-and-forth final minute. Devin Booker made a 3-pointer to put the Suns ahead 106-104 with about 30 seconds left, just moments after Jusuf Nurkic sank his own 3 to put the Blazers up 104-103. Nurkic tied the game at 106-all with his putback after an offensive rebound with 23 seconds left.

Margiela Madman does it again \ud83d\udd25 #RipCity | @JeramiGrant pic.twitter.com/Sn44p9Oktc Portland led for most of the night and built a 15-point lead midway through the third quarter, but settled for an 86-80 advantage heading into the fourth. That\u2019s about the time the cold-shooting Suns finally started hitting some shots. Damion Lee made three 3-pointers in the fourth, including one from the corner with 4:15 left that tied the score at 97. Grant shot 10 of 17 from the field. Nurkic added 14 points and eight rebounds. Portland is now tied with Phoenix atop the Western Conference at 6-2. The Suns\u2019 two losses both came against the Blazers. Booker led the Suns with 25 points, while Deandre Ayton added 24 points and eight rebounds. The Blazers were playing without the high-scoring backcourt of Damian Lillard (right calf strain) and Anfernee Simons (left foot inflammation). The two have combined to average 53 points per game this season. The Suns had their own injury issues. They were missing both of their backup point guards \u2014 Cam Payne and Duane Washington Jr. \u2014 so when All-Star Chris Paul was on the bench it was a challenge to get good shots. The Trail Blazers took advantage of the Suns\u2019 sloppy second unit on the way to a 59-49 halftime lead. Grant led the Blazers with 18 points while Ayton also had 18 points for the Suns before the break. Suns forward Cam Johnson left the game in the first quarter when he injured his right knee. Johnson scored a season-high 29 points in Tuesday\u2019s win over the Timberwolves. He appeared to suffer the injury when the Suns were in transition.

The halfway mark of a long, grueling season. This year, the League has seen some unfortunate injuries, unexpected underdog wins and disappointing campaigns by teams and players who are usually at the peaks of their games. And like a long race, the halfway point of this NFL season might be the most challenging. In a marathon, the 13.1 mark is tricky and treacherous. That's the point where you marvel at how far you've come while shuddering to think about how far you've still got to go. And that's what all the players taking the gridiron in Week 9 are likely saying to themselves, \"almost there, almost there.\" Now, for us mere mortals. We aren't running the same race as these world-class athletes, but we have a chance to break some sweat while playing a fun game of our own. That game is the FOX Bet Super 6 NFL Sunday Challenge. FOX Bet Super 6 is a free-to-play contest where you pick the winners of all six marquee games with their margins of victory for a chance to win $100,000 in our NFL Sunday Challenge.

But before you do, we're here to help. Check out our predictions for the Week 9 marquee matchups! Chargers at Falcons (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX) It seems the Falcons do everything in their will to give away games. Had it not been for Panther DJ Moore's ill-advised celebration that lengthened Carolina's PAT kick, the Falcons might have fallen to their division rival last week. But, alas! The Falcons improved to 4-4 in Week 8, and they're atop the NFC South. But what happens when the Chargers bolt into the A in Week 9? ATL is 6-2 against the spread (ATS), so we expect the Dirty Birds to cover the +3 at FOX Bet . And considering quarterback Marcus Mariota is 9-5 ATS as a home underdog in his career, the trends certainly lean toward an Atlanta cover. But we're going Chargers when it comes to a straight-up (SU) win in this contest. The Bolts are coming off a bye week, so they've had time to hit the reset button after their Week 7 loss to Seattle . The Chargers have only allowed 10 sacks this season, the fewest in the NFL. And running back Austin Ekeler has already racked up 53 receptions. At this pace, he's on track to have 128 receptions on the year, which would be a single-season record for an RB. The bye week and the spark that Austin will give this offense make us lean LAC. Prediction: Chargers by 1 to 2 points Panthers at Bengals (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX) We told you this last week, and we'll tell you again. Fade the Panthers. We almost feel bad for picking on the Panthers each week, but they make it too easy. They're 2-6 SU and 3-5 ATS. And now they're taking those awful records into Week 9 against a Bengals team that got embarrassed by the Browns on Monday Night Football. If you thought Carolina's game last week against the Falcons ended on an ugly note, wait until you see what an angry Cincinnati squad does to the Panthers. Several years have passed since these two have squared off. The last meeting was in 2018 when the Panthers beat the Bengals 31-21. But these aren't yesteryear's Stripes. Joe Burrow's 2,329 passing yards lead the NFL, and Vonn Bell's four interceptions are tied for best in the league. When Burrow's the favorite as a starter, he has gone 10-6 SU. Guess what the line is at FOX Bet this week? Joe Cool & Co. are 7.5-point favorites over Carolina. Cincy over Carolina. Prediction: Bengals by 11 to 13 points Packers at Lions (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX) Yes, Green Bay's top receiving target Davante Adams jetted for the Raiders . And yes, we knew the Packers would have some obstacles trying to re-establish their offensive identity. But no, we did not know it would be this challenging for the Cheeseheads. The Packers are 3-5 SU and 3-5 ATS, and Aaron Smartest Man in the Room Rodgers is holding no punches in letting the world know how he really feels . Their Week 9 opponents, the lowly Lions, are having an even more challenging season. They're 1-6 SU, but unlike Green Bay, no one seriously had them winning the Super Bowl this season. At FOX Bet, the Packers are 3.5-point favorites , and that's a line we like. That's mostly because Rodgers historically has had success against Detroit. He's 18-6 SU in career starts against the Lions. Also, the Packers have not lost five games in a row since 2008 \u2014 Aaron's first year as a starter. We don't want to call this a bounce-back game because we don't expect Green Bay to look that good. So we'll call this a win for the Pack and a close one, at that. Prediction: Packers by 1 to 2 Vikings at Commanders (1 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX) Go ahead and crown Kirk Cousins King of the NFC North but not because he's some QB phenom. Actually, his numbers so far this season have been average. Cousins' 11 TDs rank 10th in the league, and his 1,734 passing yards rank 14th. But the Vikes have rolled to a 6-1 overall record. So even if he's not the reason they're winning, he's certainly not causing them to lose. In this league, that matters. Just ask 2019-era Jimmy Garoppolo . And speaking of average, the Commanders have staked their claim on mediocrity this season, too. They're 4-4 SU and ATS. However, their comeback win against the Colts last week showed how gritty this squad can be with backup QB Taylor Heinicke at the helm. But grit won't save them this weekend when they face the Vikes. On defense, Za'Darius Smith's 13 tackles for loss are the best in the NFL. On offense, running back Dalvin Cook recorded a season-high 111 rushing yards in Week 8. So again, Cousins at QB is a very small piece of the successful puzzle in Minnesota. But the Vikings are still successful, nonetheless. Minnesota pulls through here. Prediction: Vikings by 7 points Seahawks at Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET Sunday, FOX) It's hard not to love the Hawks right now. Well, that is if you're not a fan of the Rams , Niners or Cardinals. But Geno Smith's redemption arc as the Seahawks' starting QB in the wake of Russell Wilson's departure has been a marvelous storyline. Geno has passed for 1,924 yards this season, 13 TDs and has thrown only five interceptions in eight games. Seattle has made it to November with a winning 5-3 record. That's pretty impressive, especially considering this is a team whose preseason Super Bowl odds were +9000. Those odds, by the way, have shortened to +2500 . But back to the NFC West matchup at hand. If you couldn't tell from our ode to Geno & Co., we're backing Emerald City. The Seahawks have defeated the Cardinals in three of the teams' last four matchups, including Week 6 of this season. Geno leads the NFL with his 72.7% completion rate. Wide receiver Tyler Lockett is breaking records, too. He caught his 48th-career receiving TD in Week 8 and has the third-most receiving TDs in franchise history. Perhaps Tyler was onto something when he noted why the Seahawks have done well this year. Whether it was Kyler's contract standoff, the study-clause controversy or some other riff that Twitter detectives have yet to uncover, something's amiss in AZ. And against this inspired Hawks team, opponents have got to bring their A-game. Right now, the Cardinals just aren't clicking. Prediction: Seahawks by 8 to 10 points Titans at Chiefs (8:20 p.m. ET Sunday, NBC) Both the Titans and Chiefs come into this Sunday Night Football battle with 5-2 records, but FOX Bet oddsmakers have the Chiefs as -12.5-point favorites in this one. Is Kansas City currently that much better than Tennessee? Well, let's dive into it. After a bye week, KC, under coach Andy Reid is 7-2. The Chiefs lead the league in scoring offense and rank third in rushing defense. Tight end Travis Kelce leads all NFL tight ends in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. This weekend, the biggest threat to the Chiefs will be Titans' running back Derrick Henry . King Henry had a season-high of 219 rushing yards in Week 8. He's freakishly athletic and hard to contain, but if KC can stop Tennessee's run game, a Week 9 win is in the Chiefs' future. Prediction: Chiefs by 8 to 10 points Now, it's your turn to jump in and win some money!

One of the teens fired a handgun during the attempt and struck Robinson in the leg two times, right before the start of the NFL's regular season. Nearby surveillance footage showed the two suspects fled the scene without any stolen property. Robinson was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. He was released from the hospital one day after the shooting and quickly began rigorous physical therapy. The running back made his NFL regular season debut on Oct. 9 against the Tennessee Titans.

But the 73-year-old Astros manager now stands within one victory of removal from that list.

Before you make your picks for a chance at this week's 25 grand, let's dive into our predictions for Week 10 of the college football season! Texas Tech at No. 7 TCU (Noon ET Saturday, FOX and FOX Sports App) The Texas Tech Red Raiders come into this matchup with their disappointing 4-4 record and probably with a \"let's get this year over already\" attitude. Their in-state opponent has enjoyed a different kind of season. And by different, we mean perfect. The 8-0 Horned Frogs had an incredibly impressive stretch where they defeated top 20 teams in four consecutive weeks. The Frogs are so good, in fact, that our own RJ Young insists that if TCU had more brand recognition , it would be higher than No. 7. But seven is still great, and the horned amphibians have more than enough firepower to take control of this game against TTU. TCU is the only program in college football averaging at least 300 yards per game passing, 200 rushing, and at least 20 passing and 20 rushing touchdowns. The Frogs rank second in the nation in yards per play and third in scoring offense. An offensive juggernaut, to be honest. So maybe the committee did get it wrong by not ranking the Frogs higher. Either way, they'll run away with this one. Prediction: TCU by 16 to 20 points No. 20 Syracuse at Pittsburgh (3:30 p.m. ET Saturday, ACC Network) Oh, what could've been, Syracuse. Orange bettors were cruising on that Cuse moneyline for six straight weeks, but then they dropped two games to Clemson and Notre Dame in a row. This week, though, the bushel gets back on track with a win at Pitt. Now, Pitt won't be a pushover. The Panthers lead the ACC in time of possession, and on offense, they have a not-so-secret weapon in running back Israel Abanikanda . Israel leads the nation in all-purpose yards and ranks fifth in rushing. But Syracuse still has the advantage. The Orange give up just 164.5 passing yards per game, which ranks third in the nation. And they've scored on 31 of their 33 trips to the red zone this season. Syracuse also dominates the first quarters of games, outscoring opponents 82-30. This game will be too close for comfort for Syracuse in the first half, but once the Orange get their groove back, expect a bounce-back W. Prediction: Syracuse by 9 to 11 points No. 1 Tennessee at No. 3 Georgia (3:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS) This game is more than just a battle between SEC rivals. It's a matchup of SEC East foes \u2014 both undefeated and both controlling their own destinies on a path to December's coveted SEC Championship game in Atlanta. At stake are bragging rights and more importantly, a College Football Playoff berth. But only one team can win. And that one team will be the national champion Georgia Bulldogs. This game will have you biting your nails so hard that you might as well kiss your cuticles goodbye. The Dawgs are 8-point favorites at FOX Bet, but this battle will be closer than that. The Vols will give the Dawgs all they can handle Saturday. UT's offense ranks first in the nation in both scoring and total offense. The Vols allow an average of 92.9 rushing yards per game, ranking ninth in FBS. Heisman-favorite QB Hendon Hooker has thrown a TD pass in 20 straight games. That's the longest streak in the nation. So where do the Dawgs have the edge? Georgia averages 41.8 points per game, which ranks sixth in the nation. UGA also leads the nation in the red zone, going 46-of-47. And the Georgia defense is nothing to play with. That unit has held opponents scoreless in 18 quarters this season. Georgia will be energized playing between the hedges in front of its home crowd at Sanford Stadium. Sometimes, you need a little help from 92,000 of your closest friends to get you one step closer to going back-to-back. Prediction: Georgia by 5 to 6 points No. 6 Alabama at No. 10 LSU (7 p.m. ET Saturday, ESPN) In what parallel universe are we living where Bama isn't at the forefront of every CFP conversation? Welcome to the college football world of one-loss Bama. Since the Tide dropped that game to the Vols in Week 7, fans haven't been too heavy on the \"we want Bama\" talk. How quickly we forget, however, that Bama is still first in the SEC West, and they're in a prime position to represent that side of the conference in the SEC Championship game. Alabama's defense has been a huge part of its solid season. The Tide hold opponents to a 26.4% conversion rate \u2014 a percentage that ranks fifth-best in FBS. Alabama averages 6.02 yards per rush which is tied with Army for best in the nation. Also, Bama has won 49 of its last 50 games when scoring a TD on the game's first offensive possession. So if the Tide score on their first offensive possession this weekend, the Tigers can load up the buses. We're only partially kidding. After all, the 6-2 season that LSU has put together \u2014 a season where the squad averages 35.1 points per game \u2014 is one the Tigers should be proud of. But we like the Tide to roll in a close one. Prediction: Alabama by 7 to 8 points No. 24 Texas at No. 13 Kansas State (7 p.m. ET Saturday, FS1) Texas was supposed to be back. The Longhorns lost a 20-19 heartbreaker to Alabama in Week 2. Texas fans were happy with how close the Horns played the Tide. Bettors were pleased with the cover. Then Texas lost to Texas Tech, but that 37-34 loss was also close. But then they lost again to Oklahoma State \u2014 a 41-34 defeat that, by all accounts, the Longhorns should have won. This weekend, Burnt Orange gets another chance to prove its program is moving toward elite status. But Kansas State is red-hot and rolling, so Week 10 will be all about the Wildcats. We really could play the game film of K-State obliterating Oklahoma State last week and call it a day. Who wants to face that team the week after that showing? Well, the Longhorns get that honor, and this is what they're in for: A Wildcat team that has racked up 11 interceptions this season, allows opponents an average of just 17.3 points per game and outscores teams 164-60 in the first half. Expect State to go wild. Prediction: Kansas State by 9 to 11 points No. 4 Clemson at Notre Dame (7:30 p.m. ET Saturday, NBC) Let's say the quiet part out loud. This will be a cupcake game for Clemson. And that just shouldn't be the case, but that's what we anticipate based on how uninspired the Fighting Irish have played this year. Notre Dame is 5-3 and has lost games to Ohio State, Stanford and Marshall ! No shade at Marshall but Marshall? After all the hype surrounding new head coach Marcus Freeman's hiring, the season has been an ultimate letdown in South Bend. Though the Tigers are the better team, they've had a couple of near-death experiences themselves. It took the Tigers two overtimes to defeat Wake Forest , and they beat Syracuse 27-21 in a game that the Orange led most of the way. But even if it has been by the skin of their teeth, they've managed a perfect 8-0 record. And the Tigers have done this with their scoring offense and defense that both rank in the nation's top 20. Leprechauns won't be so lucky this week. Prediction: Clemson by 5 to 6 points So are you ready to play to win $25,000 ?

Head coach Gerard Gallant faces a small handful in preparing for the match Sunday at the Garden against the Red Wings.", "content": "Lineup decisions? Head coach Gerard Gallant faces a small handful in preparing for the match Sunday at the Garden against the Red Wings. Let\u2019s discuss: 1. If Ryan Lindgren, who left the loss Thursday to the Bruins midway through the first period with an upper body issue minutes after being blindsided by David Pastrnak, is unable to go on Sunday, Libor Hajek will replace him in the lineup. There is no other option available under the law. The Blueshirts, who are at the NHL roster max of 23, could clear a spot by placing Vitali Kravtsov on retroactive IR, but they would not have the cap space to promote an alternate replacement even if that were a germ of a thought. They have six healthy defensemen, so the Rangers and their $200,000 of space would not qualify for an emergency exemption. Plus, if Hajek isn\u2019t deemed worthy of stepping in when injury strikes, why on Earth have the Rangers been protecting him from waivers since the start of last season? But I wonder if Hajek would simply slide into Lindgren\u2019s spot on Adam Fox\u2019s left side or whether Gallant would take this opportunity to split the K\u2019Andre Miller-Jacob Trouba pair that has been inviolate since the first weeks of Miller\u2019s rookie season and move Miller to Fox\u2019s left side. Miller and Trouba have been paired together for every game in which both have been in the lineup since the third game of the 2020-21 season \u2014 in which Lindgren skated with Trouba, Miller played with Brendan Smith and Fox was joined by Jack Johnson. Per NaturalStatTrick, Miller has played a career 2,634 minutes at five-on-five. He has been on with Trouba for 1,989 minutes, or 75 percent of the time. Join Post Sports+ for exciting member-only features , including real-time texting with Mollie Walker about the inside buzz on the Rangers. But neither Miller nor Trouba is operating at his best through the opening 12 games. Miller has not used a dominant preseason as a springboard into the year. His decision-making has been faulty, with his defensive zone coverage going in and out. Trouba has been somewhat less physical and a bit more erratic than he was last season. Maybe this is the time for a break. If so, why not Miller with Fox and Zac Jones, who has been far more assertive playing the last three straight following successive scratches and got a career-high 23:46 against the B\u2019s, with Trouba to round out the top four with Hajek and Braden Schneider comprising the third pair? 2. I think everyone appreciates the effort Alexis Lafreniere is making in his transition to right wing. But it seems apparent he is much more comfortable and plays a far more instinctive game on his natural left side. So if Filip Chytil, sidelined for the last six games with a suspected concussion he sustained early in the previous match on Oct. 23, is able to return against Detroit, that would represent an opportunity to get Lafreniere back to left wing by reuniting him with No. 72. That would give the Rangers their best chance to become a three-line deep offensive threat while giving Lafreniere his best chance to succeed by playing, a) in his preferred position; and b) alongside a center with whom he is simpatico and has achieved his greatest success. By the way, the Blueshirts won\u2019t be a three-line deep threat until the Mika Zibanejad-Chris Kreider connection gets its first-unit act in gear. Through 12 games, Zibanejad has yet to score at five-on-five. And through 12 games, Kreider \u2014 invisible against Boston \u2014 has one goal at five-on-five. Indeed, the players who skated on the third line against the B\u2019s \u2014 Jimmy Vesey, Barclay Goodrow and Julien Gauthier \u2014 have amassed four goals at full strength to the three that first-liners Kreider, Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko have recorded. But back to the original point. Moving Lafreniere to Chytil\u2019s left side provides the Rangers with a legit third-line threat. Doing so also opens up a top-six spot on the right that I would fill with Goodrow while using Vesey to fill out the third line. I\u2019d just as soon move Goodrow up with Zibanejad and Kreider while shifting Kakko to the second line with Panarin and Trocheck, but I\u2019m not sure Gallant would want to break everything up at this juncture. Plus, this might signal an overreaction to a bad night against a premium opponent that followed three consecutive victories. Then again, such moves might be needed to jolt the offense of this team that ranks 23rd in five-on-five goals per 60:00. 3. The Blueshirts have the Red Wings on Sunday and the Islanders at home Tuesday before a Thursday-Saturday trip to Nashville and Detroit that precedes the Nov. 13 Garden contest against the Coyotes. I\u2019d expect Jaro Halak, who is 0-3 with an .867 save percentage and 3.69 goals against average and hasn\u2019t played since Oct. 26 on the Island, to start two of these next five contests, most likely both games against Detroit. It is imperative that Igor Shesterkin and Halak both find their game for a team whose .905 save percentage at five-on-five ranks a disastrous 25th.", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-20.308595657348633, 0.2039320319890976]}, {"title": "Trump gets deadline extended by Jan. 6 panel to hand over Capitol riot docs", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/trump-gets-deadline-extended-by-jan-6-panel-to-hand-over-capitol-riot-docs/", "description": "The committee noted in its extension that Trump and his legal team have been in contact with the panel since it issued a subpoena for documents.", "content": "The House Jan. 6 committee on Friday extended the deadline for former President Donald Trump to produce documents related to the Capitol riot.

The Standard Time Act of 1918 was the country\u2019s first nationwide daylight-saving law. \"The act, which built off an earlier campaign by railroad companies to synchronize their schedules in North America , established five time zones across the continental United States and Alaska and, importantly, mandated that clocks be advanced one hour on the last Sunday in March and set back one hour on the last Sunday in October,\" the History, Art & Archives wrote in its report.

Exchange student Claudio Mandia was found dead in a room at EF Academy in Thornwood in February, having hung himself on the eve of his 18th birthday. The teen had just been expelled for cheating on a math assignment, and was forced by school officials to stay in a room alone, according to the lawsuit filed in Westchester County Supreme Court on Friday by his father, Mauro Mandia, and another representative of the boy\u2019s estate. The suit accuses school officials of contributing to Claudio\u2019s death by putting him in solitary confinement while he was emotionally vulnerable, despite knowing that Claudio had been dealing with personal issues that had impacted his school performance. \u201cIt was painfully foreseeable that forcing [Claudio] into solitary confinement, malnourishing him, and inadequately supervising him after delivering the life-altering news that he would be expelled \u2013 all while he was enduring other hardships that EF Academy knew about and was treating him for \u2013 could result in his tragic death,\u201d the lawsuit states. The suit alleges wrongful death, negligence, false imprisonment and emotional distress, among other charges against EF Academy, four school officials, its parent company and 20 other unnamed defendants. Claudio\u2019s family is demanding punishment for the school as well as compensation. A spokesperson for the school told N BC News in a statement that the filling contained \u201cmultiple inaccurate statements\u201d and disputed the claim that Claudio was \u201cplaced in solitary confinement.\u201d \u201cThe narrative that is shared in the legal filing is not accurate or based on fact,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are confident that the legal process will allow us to provide and prove a fact-based legal case recounting what actually transpired.\u201d Mandia and Elisabetta Benesatto enrolled their son at EF Academy \u2014 which has a whopping tuition of $66,500 per year for students who live full-time on campus \u2014 in the fall of 2020 after he expressed interest in an international academic experience before attending a university in Italy, according to the suit. He was accepted to the school\u2019s two-year International Baccalaureate Program. In his first year at the school, he received relatively good grades \u2014 including an \u201cA\u201d in math \u2014 and was noted by his teachers as \u201chaving a good sense of humor,\u201d \u201chelpful\u201d and \u201ca very good math student,\u201d according to the suit. In November 2020, another Italian student who was expelled from the academy also attempted suicide, according to the suit, which notes Claudio was not involved in that incident. The following year, trouble began for the teenager. He was forced to stay at home in Battipaglia, Italy after the school\u2019s winter break after several family members contracted COVID-19. \u201cThis caused [Claudio] to fall behind in his academic work, and when [Claudio] did return to campus after being quarantined, he was under a lot of pressure to try and catch up,\u201d the suit alleges. \u201cThen, less than two weeks after his delayed return to campus, [Claudio] suffered the unexpected loss of a close family member, which upset him terribly and caused him to seek counseling from EF Academy\u2019s in-house social worker Chelsea Lovece,\u201d the suit says. While Claudio was seeking mental help, he was expelled for plagiarism and placed in solitary confinement on Feb. 14 until his parents arrived to pick him up.

The following morning, Claudio\u2019s younger sister, who was also a student at the school, then pleaded with Lovece to check on her brother.

According to Almaguer, citing several law enforcement sources with direct knowledge, it was Paul Pelosi who opened the door for police when they arrived. Now you'll remember that authorities had previously told us that the intruder, David DePape, had broken into Paul Pelosi's bedroom on the third floor of the house and woken him up. Yet somehow, both Pelosi and DePape were on the ground floor by the time police got there. Moreover, according to Almaguer, Pelosi and DePape had been together in the house for at least half an hour, and yet strangely, they both seemed fine. With police present, Almaguer reported Paul Pelosi \"did not immediately declare an emergency or leave his home.\" Instead, he \"walked back several feet toward the assailant and away from police.\" What? Paul Pelosi walked away from the police and toward David DePape? What could possibly explain behavior like that and what were they doing for the 30 minutes before police arrived? Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't want to know. Paul Pelosi's personal life is his business. It's not our business. We've got nothing against the guy. We believe in privacy. But unfortunately for Paul Pelosi, there's an election coming next week and his wife's allies immediately politicized the assault against him. They tried to tell us that David DePape, a homeless, illegal alien, nudist, drug addict who had a BLM flag hanging near the broken school bus that he lives in, was actually a right-wing hitman inspired by Q, determined to act out the violence of January 6 in Nancy Pelosi's own home. They told us that like we'd believe it. Then the president of the United States went on television and said it again. It's laughably absurd. Russia bombed its own pipeline. Ok, but they said it and they're still saying it. NBC SILENT AFTER RETRACTING PAUL PELOSI REPORT UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES Paul Pelosi was allegedly attacked by a man looking for his wife, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (Photo by Samuel Corum/AFP via Getty Images)) Then out of nowhere comes \"The Today Show,\" the head baton twirler in the Democratic Party's media pep squad and completely, probably unintentionally, blows up their lie. After watching Almaguer\u2019s story on \"The Today Show\" this morning, you could only conclude, as Elon Musk put it, \"there's a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.\" You think? Now we know for a fact that there is more to the story because NBC News has Jeffrey Epsteined the entire thing. NBC deleted Almaguer\u2019s story both from its website and from Twitter. Why do they do that? Well, obviously, they did it because the report was true. There's no question. When was the last time you saw someone punished for lying? No one's ever punished for lying. You can lie all you want. What you can't do is tell the truth about something important. That's dangerous. You will be punished if you do that and many are punished in case you haven't noticed. So, just for fun, we called over to NBC News today. We wanted to get their explanation for why they censored their own story, but mostly, (if we're being honest) we just wanted to rub their noses in the fact that they're not journalists at all. They're obedient, little throne-sniffing servants to the party in power. Predictably, NBC News refused to tell us what was wrong with their own story. But of course, we already knew what was wrong with it. Nancy Pelosi didn't like it. That was the problem. Nancy Pelosi did appreciate the story that NBC News ran entitled \"The GOP has Paul Pelosi's blood on its Hands.\" That story remains on the NBC website tonight. It meets their \"standards.\" What are we watching here? Well, lying, obviously, but not the usual kind of lying. Normal people lie in a very recognizable way. They're human beings. They have consciences. They feel guilty about lying, so they don't go all the way. They shade the truth. SCHUMER-ALIGNED GROUP PUMPS NEARLY $50M IN SECRETIVE DONATIONS INTO MIDTERMS TO SAVE SENATE MAJORITY \"Did you eat these cookies?\" you ask your 5-year-old. \"I had one,\" he'll say, looking at you nervously. He's lying, but he's doing it to the minimum extent he feels he has to. But if you ask a sociopath the same question, you'll get a very different answer. \"Did you eat these cookies?\u2019 you'll ask. \"No,\" he will reply, looking straight in the face and smiling faintly. \"You ate them.\" That's not shading the truth. That's inverting the truth. It's scary, and you're seeing a lot of it lately. John Fetterman on \"The View\" today, for example. The one thing everyone knows about John Fetterman is that in May he suffered serious brain damage from a stroke. He can now barely speak. That's true. It's obvious. There's no debate about it. Now, if you live in Pennsylvania, you may vote for John Fetterman on Tuesday anyway, depending upon how attached you are to late term abortion, but no matter how you vote, with or against, you can't argue that John Fetterman, \"looks and sounds great\" because by any measure, he does not at all. But that's exactly what ABC hosts argued today. Watch this. SUNNY HOSTIN: I think you look and sound great. So, last week, let me ask you this, you and Dr. Oz faced off in your first televised debate and you said \"It wasn't exactly easy.\" I think it was an incredibly courageous and brave thing for you to show what healing from a stroke looks like. That's incredibly brave. On the other hand, Dr. Oz, a cardiac surgeon, in my view, came off as a bully. Does any of this surprise you, a man with a Harvard master's degree? Do you think the people of Pennsylvania saw what they needed to see from you to gain their vote? JOHN FETTERMAN: Yeah. I really believe that it wasn't an even event for me without a doubt. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS QUESTION BOSTON UNIVERSITY ON RESEARCH CREATING NEW COVID-19 STRAIN Video John Fetterman, you look and sound great . Really, ABC Lady, have you had a stroke too? How stupid do you think your audience is? Pretty stupid, apparently. This same liar described Fetterman's Senate debate performance, the one you saw as, \"incredibly courageous and brave\" like he was on the bin Laden raid instead of drooling on a stage in Harrisburg. In case you've forgotten what she was referring to, here's what it looked like. MODERATOR: You're running for a seat that could decide the balance of power in Washington. What qualifies you to be a U.S. senator? You have 60 seconds. FETTERMAN: Hi. Good night, everybody. \"Hi. Good night, everybody.\" That's not incredibly courageous. It's incredibly cruel. John Fetterman's wife ought to be shunned by decent people for allowing that to happen. She knew her husband's condition. She just wants the power. It's disgusting. And keep in mind, that's how John Fetterman talks with the help of a computer. We got a glimpse of his talking machine today. It's the size of an iron lung. ROBERT COSTA: Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke in May, used a closed captioning device during the interview with the stenographer, typing out the questions in real time. SENATORS TOUT 'BROAD SUPPORT' FOR UKRAINE AFTER KYIV VISIT AS GOP DIVIDED ON SENDING MORE AID Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, and Pennsylvania Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon, discuss reproductive freedom and the economy in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Ryan Collerd) Again, just like the question of what Paul Pelosi was doing at 2 in the morning with an illegal alien nudist, we would be just as happy, in fact, very happy to ignore this whole thing. We don't want to talk about John Fetterman's stroke. It's awful. It's depressing. John Fetterman should have dropped out of the race in May with the encouragement of his loving wife, which apparently HE doesn't have. but instead, they're pushing him. The Democratic Party is pushing him to run for the Senate despite his inability to speak and they're doing that because they want power. And for the rest of us, that means we are now required to pretend that the sad, brain damaged guy is actually incredibly brave and impressive. In other words, they're demanding that we ignore what we can see with our eyes. That's called the \"big lie\" and four days before the midterm elections , it's everywhere. Here's Joy Reid of MSNBC telling you that inflation is not real. Now, you may think, you may imagine, that you're paying more for spaghetti and two-by-fours and heating oil. Oh, no. That's the figment of your imagination. In fact, it's a diabolical psy-op engineered by the information warfare division of the Republican Party in Washington. Watch this. JOY REID: The only people I ever hear use the word inflation are journalists and economists. Right? So, that is not part of the normal lexicon of the way people talk. So, it's interesting that Republicans are doing something they don't normally do.. which is not use the common tongue. Right? Not use just common English, to sort of use, do on their campaigns like they do with crime, but what they've done is they've taught people the word \"inflation.\" Right? Most people who would have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now because they've been taught it, including on TV, including in newspapers. They've been taught this word. Someday we're going to a recurring segment called \"Guess Joy Reid\u2019s IQ.\" That'll be fun. What they've done, says the Harvard lady, i s they've taught people the word \"inflation.\" There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. The Republican Party running around teaching people words, even three syllable words. \"In-fla-tion. Inflation!\" Scary! Next, some of these MAGA people will be reading and writing their own names on legal documents and God knows what else. Stop them before they bring literacy to the population. Before you know it, people will start to believe that crime is real and for the record, it's not. POMPEO BRUSHES OFF FAR-LEFT PROTESTERS WHO INTERRUPTED SPEECH: \u2018THIS COULD ONLY HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES' AL SHARPTON: But there's a major concern surrounding the racist rhetoric that often goes hand in glove with the law-and-order messages. REID: Republicans are pulling out all the old fear and loathing playbook, trying to scare voters about crime. HILLARY CLINTON: They're not concerned about voter safety. They just want to keep voters scared. CHARLES COLEMAN: They have now turned to a strategy that sensationalizes crime, that weaponizes crime and that racializes crime. PHIL MURPHY: The other guys play the crime card relentlessly and shame, shame, shamelessly. It's got racial elements to it. Let's just call that for what it is. CHRIS HAYES: Type of crime that scares Republican and independent voters the most to make them believe that crime is skyrocketing, that America is a hellhole and the thing is, it works. Dystopian, nakedly racist video, preferably grainy security cam footage featuring almost exclusively Black people committing crime in big cities. HAWLEY SHOOTS DOWN GOP TALK OF USING DEBT LIMIT AS LEVERAGE ON SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE Video See, that's the thing. You know what they're doing? Do you know what they're doing, these racists? They're weaponizing crime. It's not the guy with the weapon who's the problem, the one stealing your purse or raping you or breaking into your house or carjacking you with the kids in the back. No, no, no. That's not the weapon that we need to worry about. The weapon is you're noticing that it's happening and in case you don't believe that, we have statistics and they appeared the other day on CNN. CNN read a report on FBI crime stats showing that crime is down. See, crime is down. These are numbers! Kind of forgot to mention that the FBI report they cited left out 40% of major cities in the United States, including the two biggest New York and Los Angeles. Just kind of forgot that, except for the population centers, but, you know, Bangor and Great Falls. Totally fine! It's totally fine! Again, this is not a small lie. Not a small lie! It's a big lie, the big lie, but that's a phrase they use. Of course, they do. They're also denying there's anything wrong with our southern border. There is nothing wrong with our southern border! There's no invasion. 5 million people? 5 million friends more for dinner. Not a big deal. By the way, if you got video of it, it's probably fake . Actually, we do. Here it is. STEPHANIE RUHLE: Clearly this is major news. This is a former president of the United States getting subpoenaed. While this huge news event was breaking, what was Fox News airing? Crime, crime, crime, crime, inflation, immigration. That's all they do all day, every day. Just going right to the fears of the American people. KIMBERLY ATKINS STOHR, BOSTON GLOBE: We saw JD Vance harping on the issue of crime and talking, linking it to things like illegal immigration. Those are the types of issues, the things that drive fear. CHRISTINA GREER, FORDHAM PROFESSOR: They're just coming straight out and especially during election time, we see it's the caravans again. It's the fear of immigrants. MICHAEL STEELE: They were scaring suburban White women with caravans coming to their neighborhood. RUHLE: You turn on Fox News any time of day, any day of the week, there are three messages on repeat: the border crisis, crime on the rise and inflation. PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE: REPUBLICAN DR. MEHMET OZ TAKES LEAD OVER DEMOCRAT JOHN FETTERMAN IN NEW POLL Video Why aren\u2019t they talking about climate change? Haven\u2019t they seen the Greta videos? Climate change is what matters. Instead, they're talking about their country, their stupid country, because 5 million people show up. You're racist if you notice. Again, nothing you just heard refutes in any way the facts that Fox News puts on a loop. What it addresses is you and the person it attacks is you because you dared to notice. Shut up. You're not allowed to notice and don't you dare vote against it. Of the many lies they're pushing, maybe the most bewildering of all, is the idea that you can destroy democracy by voting. Really? We are under the impression you destroy democracy with artillery or by changing the population of your country by opening the borders, thereby watering down the voting power of the population, its citizens. That might be destroying democracy, but no. Now we've learned that the real attack on democracy is electoral disobedience. Watch this. PRESIDENT BIDEN: Make no mistake. Democracy is on the ballot for all of us. JOCELYN BENSON, MICHIGAN SEC OF STATE: Democracy is on the ballot. SEN. MAGGIE HASSAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE: Democracy is on the ballot. Think about this. BIDEN: Democracy is on the ballot. MANDELA BARNES: Democracy is actually on the ballot. LAURA COATES: Democracy is on the ballot. ASTEAD HERNDON, CNN ANALYST: Democracy is on the ballot. PELOSI: And Democracy is on the ballot. LAWRENCE O\u2019DONNELL: Do you believe democracy is on the ballot in Utah? EVAN MCMULLIN: It is on the ballot. BIDEN: Democracy is on the ballot this year in America. VAN JONES: Somebody needs to tell voters what they need to hear which is that democracy is on the ballot. OHIO CONGRESSMAN'S NIECE KILLED DURING SOUTH KOREA HALLOWEEN STAMPEDE U.S. President Joe Biden departs from Holy Spirit Catholic Church after attending Mass on St. Johns Island, South Carolina, U.S., August 13, 2022. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) This is ultimately a news show. We have our opinions, but it's also incumbent on us to check the facts. We have a sample ballot here, and we're checking and it turns out democracy is not on the ballot. There are actually names of candidates who are on the ballot and you get to choose one as a voter, the one who best represents you and you get to choose any candidate you want because it's a democracy, meaning you run the government because it's your country. So no, democracy is not on the ballot and of course, they knew that. What they're really telling you is that the threat to democracy is voters. Don't you dare destroy this beautiful representative government by asking it to represent you. How dare you! Democracy means supporting Joe Biden and anything less than that is insurrection. That's the script they're reading and the amazing thing is some of the more feeble-minded among them actually seem to believe it. So, Michael Beschloss, for example. Beschloss is living proof they don't have to pass an IQ test to become a historian. You just have to call yourself one. I'm historian Michael Beschloss . They hauled in Beschloss the other day from semi-retirement to ruminate about democracy and they expected him to say \"democracy is on the ballot\" and he may have said that, but as he got going, he lost control of himself. Watch this. HISPANIC VOTERS COULD BE KEY TO SEVERAL MIDTERM RACES: 'SU VOTO ES SU VOZ' Video BESCHLOSS: And a historian 50 years from now, if historians are allowed to write in this country and if there are still free publishing houses and a free press, which I'm not certain of, but if that is true, a historian will say what was at stake tonight and this week was the fact whether we will be a democracy in the future, whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed. We're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system and it could be a week away. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A week away! What? We don't know where Michael Beschloss is broadcasting from. It didn't look like a bunker. It looked like a French country kitchen that his decorator put together, but whatever. Hop he's stockpiling low carb pasta because it could be a dark tomorrow. Now, keep in mind, this is the guy who is advising Joe Biden on extremism, but needless to say, he does not regard himself as an extremist. If you vote Republican, your children will be arrested and killed . That's his campaign slogan. It's not quite as reassuring as, say, a \"chicken in every pot\" or even \"hope and change,\" but at this point, Democrats are out of hope and above all, they fear change. They want things to stay exactly the way they are. Tucker Carlson currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel\u2019s (FNC) Tucker Carlson Tonight (weekdays 8PM/ET).

And it\u2019s about time we embraced reform. So, which brave \u201ckey Republicans\u201d are \u201copenly talking\u201d and \u201copenly broaching\u201d the idea of reforming Social Security and Medicare ? We don\u2019t know, because the author, Jim Tankersley, doesn\u2019t offer a single quote from anyone in the GOP making that argument \u2014 not an elected official, not a candidate, not even some fringe backbencher spouting off. How can one of the most prestigious newspapers in the country run a 1,500-word piece asserting that a major political party has been \u201ctalking\u201d about a highly controversial policy position and not substantiate the claim with a single quote? That would be the first question of any competent editor. Of course, as much as I wish it existed, there is no plan or campaign or reform effort aimed at slashing or weaning us off entitlements. The entire ginned-up issue basically relies on a single line from Rick Scott\u2019s \u201cSave America\u201d agenda, which Mitch McConnell rejected as soon as it appeared. (You\u2019ll find out about that in paragraph 13.) In truth, Scott doesn\u2019t even target Social Security or Medicare reform specifically, but rather supports an audit and renewal of all federal programs every five years. (The Times incorrectly says \u201cevery year.\u201d) There is a strong case to be made that revisiting legislation every few years is far more \u201cdemocratic\u201d than compelling millions to live with antiquated economic ideas that were popularized during the Depression. But only a Republican, not Republicans, has embraced that idea. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address.

Not that any of it stops Tankersley from going on about how \u201cseveral influential Republicans have signaled a new willingness to push for Medicare and Social Security spending cuts.\u201d Several, huh? The hyperlink bolstering this assertion leads us to a more nuanced Bloomberg Government piece by Jack Fitzpatrick that details possible GOP efforts to use the debt ceiling as a negotiating tool to curb perpetual, massive auto-spending. As we learn in paragraph 23 of the Times story, \u201cDemocrats and Republicans largely agree Congress will need to ensure the solvency of the programs in the decade to come. Spending for the programs is projected to balloon in the coming decade as more baby boomers retire.\u201d Among the ideas the Republican Study Committee bring to the table is gradually raising the retirement age for some workers due to higher life expectancy (with increased benefits). And Bloomberg quotes Lloyd Smucker saying we may need future reductions of benefits for wealthy Americans to save the program from insolvency. President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to raise payroll taxes on the rich to save the program is also in effect a reduction of benefits for the wealthy. But, again, the Bloomberg piece does not feature a single person \u201ctalking\u201d or proposing slashing Social Security or Medicare programs. Whenever Democrats latch onto some new scaremongering effort \u2014 \u201csaving democracy\u201d or \u201cvoting rights,\u201d or whatever hysteria is being flouted \u2014 establishment media instantly take up the issue, often ham-fistedly backfilling the accusations with alleged reporting. Though the Times piece does not offer any Republicans \u201ctalking\u201d about cutting Social Security, it does give Biden, Barack Obama and other Democrats the space to go off on this imaginary threat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been paying into Social Security your whole life. You earned it. Now these guys want to take it away,\u201d Biden is quoted saying during a visit to Hallandale Beach, Fla. \u201cWho in the hell do they think they are? Excuse my language.\u201d Obama, who never shies away from flogging a strawman to within inches of its life, says that American retirees \u201chad long hours and sore backs and bad knees to get that Social Security.\u201d As Obama \u2014 though, perhaps, not Biden \u2014 knows very well, there is no proposal from Republicans to take Social Security from those who\u2019ve paid in. Not even George W. Bush, the last Republican to \u201copenly\u201d campaign on reforming the untenable entitlement infrastructure, has ever proposed taking a penny from anyone who paid into it. That was always a lie. Even those reforms would only have allowed \u2014 not compelled \u2014 new participants to divert a portion of their tax dollars to private retirement accounts and opt out of an unsustainable, state-run Ponzi scheme that brought them back a paltry 1% return on their \u201cinvestment.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, though, no one is going to reform entitlements.

Period. They are smart, they communicate, they are selfless. When you do that and add some talent to it, that means you give yourself a chance.\u201d Three of the four starters, plus slot corner Michael Carter, are 25 or younger, so it could be the makings of a group with staying power. Gardner, who will draw the hardest matchup of his stellar season to date against Stefon Diggs, is garnering the most attention, but Oden hasn\u2019t sensed any jealousy even after the rookie was named AFC Player of the Week on Oct. 26. \u201cYou take a specific person and plug him into different situations \u2026 but I think it is like the perfect ingredient for him to be in our room and this organization at this time,\u201d Oden said. \u201cPut him in a different system and it might be different, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the perfect mix of guys who like to be around each other. They have fun, but they work. They laugh, but they work. They cry, but they work. They celebrate, but they work.\u201d Reed has instilled an \u201cevery rep counts\u201d mentality in practice and physicality in tackling, and Carter is the \u201cunsung hero who does everything the right way,\u201d Oden said. Carter had one interception last week, plus a second returned for a touchdown offset by penalty. \u201cWe say a lot in our DB room, \u2018Have grace points,\u2019 \u201d Reed said. \u201cIf somebody is wrong or you are wrong, don\u2019t point the finger. See what you can do better.\u201d The Bills are averaging 29 scoreboard points, however. The Jets stifled Aaron Rodgers, but also have benefited from facing four backup quarterbacks this season.

Thibodeau shook up the Knicks\u2019 starting lineup. He went small. He even gave the Julius Randle-Obi Toppin pairing a long look. The result was a much-needed victory over the 76ers, a rally from 12 points down in the final quarter engineered by Toppin and Randle. Toppin, finally given extended minutes, hit the go-ahead 3-pointer on a Randle dish with 1:25 left, and the Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak against the short-handed Sixers, 106-104, at Wells Fargo Center. Joel Embiid was out with the flu and the 76ers were playing without a true center, so Thibodeau went to Randle and Toppin together. They duo helped the Knicks rally after a shoddy performance up until that point. Thibodeau was backed into a corner, his team was struggling and Mitchell Robinson was out with a sore right knee he suffered in the second quarter. The scuffling Knicks (4-4) were down by 12 and 10:36 remained when Thibodeau inserted Randle into the game and kept Toppin on the floor. The Knicks proceeded to outscore the 76ers by 16 over the next 10 minutes, capped by a Jalen Brunson three-point play with 1:05 left that gave the Knicks a four-point lead. Toppin scored 10 points in that stretch, and finished with 17 for the game. Brunson scored a team-high 23 points and added seven assists, while RJ Barrett had 22 points and nine rebounds. Randle added 10 rebounds, five assists and six turnovers \u2014 though none in the fourth quarter \u2014 and he hit four clutch free throws in the final 24.1 seconds. Tyrese Maxey led the 76ers (4-6), who were also without James Harden, with 31 points and Tobias Harris had 23. The sloppiness from the ugly loss to the Hawks on Wednesday night carried over into the early part of the first half Friday. The Knicks were a step slow and lazy with the ball, committing nine turnovers before the end of the opening quarter. It didn\u2019t get better to start the second stanza, with four turnovers on their first four possessions. The 76ers didn\u2019t take advantage of a number of live-ball turnovers, and the Knicks eventually settled down. Barrett, Randle, Brunson, Cam Reddish and Isaiah Hartenstein closed the first half well, outscoring the 76ers 12-5 over the final 2:52 as the Knicks took a five-point lead into the break. Brunson was particularly effective, producing 11 points and two assists in the quarter. Reddish, the last of 11 Knicks to get into the game, contributed seven points, two assists, a steal and a block. With 3:25 left in the half, after Robinson picked up his third foul, he came out of the game and went into the locker room. He did not return, due to a sore right knee, the team said. With Hartenstein replacing Robinson at the start of the second half, the Knicks built an eight-point lead. But Maxey momentarily took over, scoring 10 consecutive points in a 13-2 run that gave the 76ers the lead. The Knicks were stunned by the body blow, and Philadelphia kept on pushing, taking a nine-point edge into the fourth quarter as the Knicks failed to make a field goal over the final 5:47 of the quarter. In that span, they went 0-for-5 from the field with five turnovers. The deficit grew to 12. But the Knicks answered.

Similarly, we can\u2019t be sure that Harris is the first female vice president or Clinton the first female presidential candidate from a major party. Sorry, ladies, you made the rules.

Women can be forgiven for wondering what exactly that moment entails. Hochul shrugs off crime in New York, Harris is part of an administration that keeps trying to spend its way out of inflation, and Hillary Clinton exists on the national stage mostly to insult us into voting for Democrats, as she did last week when she said voters \u201cdon\u2019t really understand\u201d what\u2019s at stake in the midterms.

Kathy Hochul has awarded a $4.3 million contract to investigate New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo-led response to the coronavirus outbreak \u2014 drawing fire from critics who accuse her of slow-walking the probe until after Tuesday\u2019s election. The one-year contract goes to consultant the Olson Group, an emergency management firm in Alexandria, Va. Hochul, who was lieutenant governor during the pandemic, first announced the planned probe in July. But critics say the timing of the firm\u2019s hire is curious \u2014 announced during the final days of a gubernatorial campaign where Hochul is fighting for her political life in a closer than expected race against Republican opponent Lee Zeldin . \u201cGiven that COVID killed more than 75,000 New Yorkers \u2014 and the next virus could arrive at any time \u2014 the state\u2019s leaders might have been expected to show more urgency in studying how to improve their operations,\u201d said Bill Hammond, health analyst at the Empire Center for Public Policy, in a blog post. \u201cThe hiring came more than two and half years after the state learned how tragically unprepared it was for a major pandemic, and 15 months after a governor resigned rather than face impeachment in part because of how he handled the crisis,\u201d he wrote. The results of the review could be explosive, scrutinizing life-and-death decisions made during the worst period of the COVID-19 outbreak, not only by the disgraced ex-Gov. Cuomo but also the politically powerful hospital and nursing home industries that now largely support Hochul. A no-holds barred probe could also question what role Hochul played in decision-making during the pandemic. The awarding of the contract was first reported by Spectrum News\u2019 State of Politics. Hammond has reservations about the study, which is being overseen by the governor\u2019s office and the state Division of Homeland Security. He said the investigation of what happened should be independent and the consultant should have subpoena power to get information. \u201cThere\u2019s very little reason to believe they will rock the boat,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cSo far, the Hochul administration\u2019s efforts on this front are sending troubling signals. Fully analyzing New York\u2019s response to a catastrophe as big as COVID-19 should be a major, urgent priority for the state government \u2013 not something to be grudgingly addressed years later by a consultant on a skimpy budget.\u201d Cuomo came under fire for a controversial March 2020 edict that required nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients released from hospitals, even though the former governor himself previously said the highly contagious killer bug had spread through the facilities like \u201cfire through dry grass\u201d \u2014 killing more than 15,000 frail, immunosuppressed elderly residents.

Investigative reports by state Attorney General Letitia James and Comptroller Tom DiNapoli found that the Cuomo administration initially undercounted nursing home deaths by half and The Post exposed a strategy to cover up the true results amid a federal probe.

He also had government staffers help draft the book, titled \u201cAmerican Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d Leaders of Voices for Seniors, the major advocacy group for thousands of nursing home families whose loved ones were killed by COVID, said Hochul failed them and have endorsed Lee Zeldin for governor. \u201cIf Gov. Hochul can sit in a room in front of crying and heart-torn families, while promising an investigation and has failed to deliver; how can we believe she will keep any promise to her constituents,\u201d the group said in a statement endorsing Zeldin. Vivian Zayas, co-founder of Voices for Seniors and whose mother, Ana Martinez, died of COVID in a Long Island nursing home, said, \u201cWe believe our cries for justice will no longer fall on deaf ears under a Zeldin Administration. We have not forgotten and will not forget Gov. Hochul abandoning our families.\u201d Zeldin \u2014 who promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigative pandemic-related nursing home deaths if elected \u2014 accused Hochul of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the COVID-related scandals because he served as Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor when they occurred and \u201cshe knows it.\u201d \u201cHochul never said a word about the administration\u2019s deadly nursing home order and cover up. She was silent as State Health Department officials went to private residences of the administration\u2019s family and friends to provide VIP testing near the start of the pandemic,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cHochul remained AWOL as taxpayer-funded administration staffers were being misused to write Andrew Cuomo\u2019s $5.1 million self-congratulatory book\u2026 Instead of swift answers, she\u2019s dragging her feet just long enough so that the initial findings don\u2019t come out until after the November election.

The news of the arrest came after the family had learned that \u201cthis is not an episode of \u2018Law & Order,\u201d and it might be some time before an arrest was made in the case \u2014 if ever. \u201cAnd to be completely honest, yes, I was starting to give up hope,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting to consider what it would be like to live rest of my life knowing no one would be held accountable for killing our son. But I also understand that this is not over. \u201cWe are still a while away from a conviction, so I will not consider this a true success until Justice has been brought to our family by the people of New York City,\u201d he added. Ethan Williams had become obsessed with the Big Apple ever since he saw the movie \u201cSpider-Man\u201d as a young child, his dad said. As a sophomore in the film media program at Indiana, he finally got his chance to visit New York on a \u201cdream trip\u201d with some friends to film skateboarding videos. Instead Williams\u2019 dream trip turned tragic. After his death, the student was remembered as a caring young man always looking to help others, whether volunteering for missionary work in Rwanda or spearheading an LGBTQ club. Hours before his tragic end, he bought a homeless man a sandwich, according to his father. The grieving dad said had prayed every day for the last two years for justice for his son. \u201cMy prayer and hope was not that Ethan\u2018s killer would get caught up in some other violence with his life taken before he saw justice,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to get into some kind of shootout with the police and die. Ethan wouldn\u2019t want that, so neither could I, even if that is a natural reaction. \u201cSimply, I prayed that he would, at some point, begin to understand the consequences of his actions and the incredible grief and pain and dashed hopes his violent actions have brought onto so many who knew and loved Ethan, and that he would do the right thing by confessing to his crimes,\u201d he went on. Still, he wants the accused to serve out a \u201cvery, very long\u201d sentence. \u201cBut I also hope that during that time he becomes the kind of man that he could be instead of remaining the man he now is,\u201d he said.

Authorities say her attacker pulled off her running shoes, workout pants and underwear and raped her before stealing her cell phone, debit card, hotel key card and ID and taking off on a Citi Bike. And Phanor is a homeless vagrant wanted for, at least, two other sex crimes. He\u2019s been charged for two previous attacks \u2014 one in late March and another in early October. He\u2019s said to have 25 more priors, mostly for petit larceny, assault, drug possession and drug dealing. Seven of those arrests were sealed.

An Oregon man who killed his commanding officer in the Army in 1976 and was freed on parole in 1988 is now charged in a cold case double murder that left two teens dead in 1974 -- thanks to modernized ballistics testing, authorities said Friday. And police are asking anyone with information on Steven Criss, 65, to come forward \u2013 because there might be \"additional homicides.\" The Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Friday that new testing shows Donald Bartron, 16, and Peter Zito Jr., 18, were killed with the same gun as Army Sgt. Jacob \"Kim\" Brown. All three victims had been shot multiple times in the head with a .22-caliber pistol, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. But the science at the time did not link the weapon to the teens' deaths. WASHINGTON WIFE BURIED ALIVE: MUFFLED SCREAMS REVEALED IN VIOLENT KIDNAPPING CAUGHT IN APPLE WATCH 911 CALL Steven Criss was arrested Wednesday, Nov. 2, using the same handcuffs a deputy placed on him back in 1974, when outdated ballistics testing failed to link his firearm to a double homicide. (Washington County Sheriff's Office) \"Just before 4 a.m. on Oct. 3, 1974, an Oregonian newspaper delivery driver reported seeing a person on the ground next to a car parked at the Oak Hills Recreation Center,\" Detective Mark Povolny said during a news briefing. The first deputy, Jim Spinden, who later became the county sheriff, arrived on scene in under three minutes, he said. Spinden found Zito dead on the ground next to a 1956 Oldsmobile with the trunk and hood open. Slumped over in the engine bay was Bartron, who investigators said was working under the hood at the time of the attack.

Spinden arrested Criss on a theft charge two months later, Povolny said, and recovered an \"illegally concealed .22\" in his car \u2013 but forensics at the time found now link between that gun and the deaths of Bartron and Zito.

Brown, whom he owed \"a few hundred dollars.\" \"Instead of paying his debt, he shot Sgt. Brown five times in the head,\" Povolny said. The victims were ambushed as they worked on a classic Oldsmobile in 1974. (Washington County Sheriff's Office) Criss pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years \u2013 but he made parole in 1988 and was released from Fort Leavenworth, authorities said. Earlier this year, detectives reviewing the case submitted ballistic evidence to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF found \"a presumptive match\" between Brown\u2019s death and the teen slayings, which took place at at the Oak Hills Recreation Center in October 1974. LISTEN TO TRUE CRIME PODCASTS FROM FOX NEWS \"This is the oldest known comparison and match on a prosecutable case ,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said Friday. Oregon state police subsequently confirmed it as well. A grand jury indicted Criss this week and deputies arrested him Wednesday using the same handcuffs Spinden had placed him in 48 years ago, Povolny said. The sheriff also issued an apology to the family of a man who had been wrongfully arrested in connection with the case. Joseph Amir Wilson was charged with the teens\u2019 murders hours after they were discovered. The charges were dropped in 1975, and Wilson died in 2000. \"It is clear Wilson was innocent and should never have been arrested,\" the sheriff\u2019s office said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Povolny added that the original detective on the case, Jim Welch, had \"never believed\" Wilson was responsible and, believing Criss had played a role, \"documented and preserved vital evidence\" in the days after the slayings.

Is it real, as Clinton seems to believe? Or is it, as Hochul has contended, an overblown campaign distraction \u2014 promoted by \u201cmaster manipulators\u201d and \u201cdata deniers\u201d to derail her bid to become New York\u2019s first elected female governor? Sisterly solidarity was the order of the day at Barnard College Thursday \u2014 with Hillary and Hochul standing shoulder-to-shoulder before a cheering, fully committed array of feminism-centric true believers. It was one of those late-campaign events where the hype is thick, where the rhetoric is hyperbolic and where the facts don\u2019t really matter. How very odd, then, that Hillary let the truth peek through. Oh, for sure, the partisan newspeak was there \u2014 darkly threatening Republicans hide behind every tree in Hillaryland, and have for decades. But suddenly she slipped. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about keeping you safe,\u201d she said \u2014 they being GOP candidate Lee Zeldin and his party mates. \u201cThey want to keep you scared.\u201d But safe from what? Frightened of whom? Crime? And criminals? Seems so. But didn\u2019t Hochul, just last Sunday, tell MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton that crime isn\u2019t real? Never mind New York\u2019s shocking body count, its bloody subway platforms, its insane penal codes and its cadre of woke district attorneys \u2014 the real problem is GOP disinformation. Republicans, she said, \u201care master manipulators. They have this conspiracy going all across America trying to convince \u2026 people that they are not safe.\u201d Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address.

True enough, she was immediately bludgeoned into conceding that crime is \u201can issue,\u201d which is not quite the same as a problem \u2014 which, in fact, vastly understates New York\u2019s crime crisis. Since the boneheaded penal-law \u201creforms\u201d of 2019 and generally reduced policing following COVID and the George Floyd rioting, violent crime in New York\u2019s cities has exploded. It\u2019s up 30% in New York City since last year \u2014 major felonies are up 10% and transit crime is up 42% over the past two years \u2014 with 24 murders. \u201cMaster manipulators\u201d at work here, as Krazy Kat claimed ? Hardly. The crime wave got a big boost from COVID, to be sure, but it\u2019s mostly the work of a New York progressive cabal determined to defang the penal code because serious law enforcement inequitably targets minorities. That\u2019s a contention crime victims themselves, overwhelmingly minorities, likely would contest \u2014 even if Hochul buys it hook, line and drive-by shooting. So how inconvenient of Hillary to puncture her fantasy balloon. \u201cI see [campaign] ads about crime every 30 seconds,\u201d she said at Barnard Thursday. \u201cNo solutions, but just a lot of really fearful, scary pictures.\u201d But \u201creally fearful, scary pictures\u201d of what, exactly? Crime scenes, of course \u2014 and thus does Hillary debunk Hochul\u2019s no-such-thing-as-a-crime-wave deflection. Plus this: Hillary says Republicans harp about crime \u2014 but offer, in her words, \u201cno solutions.\u201d Well, now. The fact is that Zeldin has been about nothing but solutions for months now \u2014 maybe to a fault, but certainly to good effect, judging from the narrowing campaign polls. Rolling back those noxious 2019 penal-law \u201creforms\u201d \u2014 especially cashless bail \u2014 is a solution. Focusing state policy on making the streets safer through vigorous law enforcement is a solution. Putting woke DAs in their place as New York\u2019s Constitution permits is a solution. And so on. Again, Lee Zeldin is bubbling over with solutions \u2014 while Krazy Kat Hochul has to be hammer-locked into admitting there is even a problem. So thanks to Hillary Clinton for injecting some reality into the Hochul campaign. People go to rallies to cheer candidates, not to hear truth \u2014 but sometimes truth emerges anyway. And now comes news that President Joe Biden will be, um, speaking on Hochul\u2019s behalf in Yonkers Sunday. The possibilities here are delicious, if likely a little daunting to the governor\u2019s staff. Because if they couldn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton to stay on message, imagine their angst over the damage Joe Biden\u2019s frightening fact-mangling could do. On such a weak hinge does Hochul\u2019s fortune swing. bob@bobmcmanus.nyc", "date": "2022-11-05", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [13.014399528503418, 11.434754371643066]}, {"title": "Elijah Moore, Denzel Mims at different places in regaining Jets standing", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/04/elijah-moore-denzel-mims-at-different-places-in-jets-standing/", "description": "Nine weeks passed between Denzel Mims\u2019 trade request and his return to making an impact for the Jets.", "content": "Nine weeks passed between Denzel Mims\u2019 trade request and his return to making an impact for the Jets. The season will be almost over if Elijah Moore has to wait that long for a resurgence after his failed attempt to move on. The two receivers with diminished roles, who both asked to be traded by the Jets before the NFL deadline came and went this week, said they are moving on and looking to contribute over the rest of the season. Head coach Robert Saleh spent a few minutes chatting up both Mims and Moore individually before practice Friday. \u201cI\u2019m with the Jets, I play for the Jets, so I\u2019m ready to see what I can do on Sunday against the Bills,\u201d Moore said. \u201cEvery day I wake up, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m definitely human and I have my [frustrated] moments, but it\u2019s a new day. I feel good. I try to reset my mind every time I go home, and I go to the things I believe in.\u201d Mims, 25, is further ahead on the road to regaining relevance. After he was a healthy scratch for the first six games, Mims found a way back through Corey Davis\u2019 knee injury. He threw a key block on a touchdown run against the Broncos and made two catches for 76 yards against the Patriots. \u201cHis attitude has been awesome,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cI feel like three weeks ago, something flipped. From his daily approach to coachability, all of it has really amplified for him. He\u2019s really taking the bull by the horns and showing a lot of maturity \u2014 not that he wasn\u2019t mature before. I really like where he is mentally.\u201d Asked if a light went on for him when Davis went out, Mims said: \u201cThe light has always been there. It just kind of lit up when I knew that it was my time to show what I can do. It\u2019s very exciting. I\u2019m trying to take advantage of every opportunity I get. It\u2019s what I always wanted.\u201d Kadarius Toney and Chase Claypool were the only NFL receivers on rookie contracts who were traded before the deadline. The Giants and Packers did not add receivers despite glaring needs. \u201cIt\u2019s life. I can\u2019t control that,\u201d Mims said about his request not being met. \u201cWhat I can control is putting good stuff on film, competing every day and doing everything I can right. \u201cI was drafted in the second round the year before [these coaches] came and brought in who they wanted. Things kind of changed. I knew I had to do everything I can plus more to get on the field. Now that I\u2019m out there, I appreciate it more.\u201d Moore, 22, is trying to get to the same place as his fellow former second-round pick. It took time for Mims, who said \u201cnothing fazes me\u201d now but he \u201clet things bother me early on.\u201d \u201cWe all learn from each other,\u201d Moore said, \u201cbut his situation is his situation and mine is mine.\u201d After totaling 12 catches for 139 yards on 21 targets in three games with Joe Flacco at quarterback, Moore has four for 64 on nine since Zach Wilson\u2019s return \u2014 a far cry from the 538 yards and five touchdowns he totaled when he and Wilson were rookies last season. Moore returned from a one-game benching by playing 10 snaps (to Mims\u2019 44) last week. \u201cWe had a great week of practice. I feel good about the plan,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to stay here, so why not be super, super positive?\u201d Davis is expected to return to the lineup after next week\u2019s bye, which will recreate the receiver logjam. But Mims thinks he is sitting on a breakout game. \u201cIf I keep preparing myself like I am, which I will, it\u2019s bound to happen,\u201d Mims said. \u201cI just have to keep my head down, keep studying the playbook, keep grinding and it will come. How I see it is Corey is not on the field right now, so I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m going to be on the field this whole game.\u2019 \u201d As Moore can attest, being on the field doesn\u2019t always equate to playmaking opportunities. His frustration boiled over when he wasn\u2019t targeted by Wilson while playing 32 snaps Oct. 16 against the Packers. \u201cLast year I felt like we had good chemistry,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe\u2019re running the same type of plays.

In the seven days since 156 people were killed in a Halloween crush in the South Korean capital, the names and stories of those who died have emerged, along with details of missed warnings and desperate calls for help. According to police emergency call logs, multiple calls were made as early as four hours before the tragedy unfolded, as the crowd in Seoul\u2019s buzzy nightlife district Itaewon became so packed that partygoers were unable to move or breathe. Videos taken over the course of that night show revelers realizing, at first slowly then in a rush of panic, that what was supposed to be a fun night out was spiraling dangerously out of control. Police ultimately sent four police dispatches to the site that evening, but too few and too late to prevent the disaster. Families are mourning the loss of their loved ones, with most victims in their teens and 20s. Amid the grief, anger has grown with demands for answers as to how things could have gone so terribly wrong. Here\u2019s a look back at how the disaster unfolded \u2013 and the early danger signs that went unheeded. Halloween in Itaewon isn\u2019t a single event held by an organizer \u2013 rather, it\u2019s a popular place for young people, often dressed in elaborate costumes, to go bar hopping and clubbing. From the Itaewon subway station, the main nightlife strip can be accessed via a sloping alleyway less than 4 meters wide (13 feet), that runs between the brick wall of the Hamilton Hotel and some stores. On weekends, the alley becomes a busy thoroughfare for people coming and going, giving it a convivial atmosphere where friends meet up and party. By 4 p.m. on October 29, crowds had become \u201csignificantly big,\u201d said Park Chang-ki, a parking attendant who worked across the road from the alley where most of the crush took place. By 5 p.m., the alley was so packed it was completely blocked off, according to the owner of a restaurant facing the alley. At 6:34 p.m., police received an emergency call \u2013 the first of 11 increasingly urgent calls that first pleaded for crowd control, then for rescuers. \u201cThat alley doesn\u2019t look safe \u2026 It feels like (people) can be crushed to death,\u201d the caller said. \u201cI barely escaped, I think you need to control this, there are simply too many people.\u201d \u201cPolice will come out and check that out,\u201d the officer responded. By 7 p.m., people in the alley were spilling out onto the adjacent main road, said Park, the parking attendant. According to police logs, the second emergency call came just after 8 p.m. , with the caller saying people were being pushed, falling and getting hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic \u2026 I think it needs to be controlled somehow,\u201d the caller said. Similar warnings, growing more dire, soon followed. Just after 8:30 p.m., a caller warned police the situation was \u201creally serious.\u201d Twenty minutes later, another caller said it felt like a \u201cmadhouse.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not a prank call,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cI beg you.\u201d Things rapidly escalated between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m, with footage showing the Itaewon streets \u2013 lined with clubs and bars blasting music \u2013 packed with revelers standing shoulder to shoulder, some pushing forward in a slow-moving wave. Crowds aren\u2019t unusual for Seoul, or for the Itaewon area, which is often full of partygoers on weekends. Some experts have said this may have contributed to the disaster, with residents unaware of the danger because they were used to being in tightly packed crowds. In a selfie video taken at 8:41 p.m. , 22-year-old French exchange student Anne-Lou Chevalier and her friends laugh about the number of people as they wait in the middle of an unmoving crowd. \u201cAt the beginning we thought it was funny,\u201d said Chevalier. \u201cWe heard Halloween in Itaewon was amazing.\u201d But unease soon set in. In a video taken just minutes later, the group\u2019s laughter has taken on a nervous edge as one girl says, \u201cJust try not to fall.\u201d Another responds, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d Shortly after, Chevalier says, they began to feel crushed; she passed out and was evacuated, with a photo taken at 8:58 p.m . that shows her being lifted away from the crowd by two men. By 9 p.m., an emergency caller urged police to \u201cmake an emergency dispatch now,\u201d saying a \u201cbig accident could occur at any moment.\u201d Several other callers around this time warned that people were being trampled on, describing the situation as \u201chorrible.\u201d One caller, at 9:02 p.m. , put it more bluntly: \u201cSomebody is going to die.\u201d By 9:30 p.m., the streets were crammed full; some people reported not even being able to exit the nearby subway station, with new partygoers still arriving in the area. By now, the danger was apparent. Ian Chang, a 21-year-old university student from Florida, arrived in Itaewon around 9:40 p.m. , planning to meet his friend Steven Blesi, another American exchange student \u2013 but the crowds were so severe he messaged Blesi at 10:17 p.m. , urging him to avoid the area. It\u2019s not clear if his warning ever reached Blesi \u2013 one of the two American victims who died that night, the other being 20-year-old Anne Gieske from Kentucky. Sometime before 10 p.m., Emily Farmer, a 27-year-old English teacher in Seoul, escaped into a bar after being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the crowds. Shortly after, she said, rumors began spreading that somebody had died and patrons were not allowed to leave. By 10:21 p.m., some began taking desperate measures; a photo shows a man scaling a wall to escape, cheered on by bystanders unaware of what was happening. Minutes later, police began receiving reports of people being \u201cburied\u201d in the crowd. \u201cAt 10:23 p.m. we received more than five reports that people fell, and they could either get hurt or die,\u201d a first responder told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Authorities rushed to the scene, where they saw up to \u201c10 rows of faces \u2013 we couldn\u2019t even see their legs,\u201d said the first responder. They said workers pulled out the people in the bottom row first \u2013 but \u201cwhen we laid them (on the ground), most of them were unconscious.\u201d The sheer volume of people also made it difficult for police to reach those who needed help. Video posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical attention. Sophia Akhiyat, an American doctor in Itaewon that night, was whisked to a side street after telling an officer she could possibly help. \u201cI was completely overwhelmed but I started CPR on the first body I saw,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so chaotic because there were so many victims on the floor, along with foot traffic and partygoers and music blasting from surrounding restaurants and clubs that had no idea what was going on.\u201d Adding to the confusion was the fact that most people were in costume that night \u2013 meaning some mistook police officers for fellow partygoers. One 20-year-old eyewitness, who requested anonymity because she did not feel comfortable having her name published, said when an officer tried to direct the crowds, she heard someone ask: \u201cIs he a real policeman?\u201d By 11:46 p.m., South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency had reported that dozens of people were receiving medical assistance after suffering from \u201ccardiac arrest,\u201d citing fire authorities. Photos show the road full of police cars, with officers cordoning off the area. At 11:55 p.m., the Seoul metropolitan government sent an emergency alert to residents in the Itaewon area, requesting vehicles to turn away due to \u201can emergency accident near Hamilton Hotel.\u201d \u201cCitizens, please return home as soon as possible,\u201d it read \u2013 which would be repeated in several more alerts in the following hours. This was more than five hours after the first emergency call had come in, with reports of the disaster beginning to circulate widely on social media. Around 12:14 a.m. , the country\u2019s National Police Agency made its first report to agency chief Yoon Hee-keun, according to Yonhap. President Yoon Suk Yeol dispatched a disaster medical assistance team to Itaewon, ordering hospitals to prepare emergency beds. By 12:30 a.m., the scale of the tragedy was becoming clear, with photos showing a line of blue body bags on the street, as first responders rushed the wounded onto stretchers and into ambulances. Just after 1 a.m., authorities released the first death toll of 59 killed as they worked frantically to transfer injured people to nearby hospitals, and bodies to multiple mortuaries. During those early hours, the city government began receiving a flood of missing persons reports, and launched the days-long effort to identify victims. By 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, as families across South Korea woke up to the news and began the agonizing search for their loved ones, the death toll had risen to 149. That toll slowly ticked up over the following days as more people succumbed to their injuries, reaching the current figure of 156. Now, the initial panic and terror of that night has transformed into nationwide devastation and calls for accountability. On Monday, authorities said they had no protocols in place for dealing with massive crowds without a specific organizer. Afterward, the prime minister said the disaster revealed South Korea\u2019s \u201clack of deep institutional knowledge and consideration for crowd management.\u201d On Tuesday, the national police chief admitted the police response to the emergency calls had been \u201cinadequate.\u201d \u201cThrough this incident, I feel deep responsibility for public safety and we will do our best to make sure such a tragedy as this does not occur again,\u201d he said, announcing a special investigative team and promising transparency. The investigation will include examining why police only made four dispatches ahead of the incident despite the high number of calls. By Wednesday , that investigative unit raided local police stations across Seoul , seizing internal reports and documents relating to the emergency calls made that night. Meanwhile, the chief of the Yongsan police station \u2013 responsible for the district where Itaewon is located \u2013 was suspended and replaced. The investigation is ongoing.

Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images hide caption Ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on July 14, in Washington, DC. Jordan and House Judiciary Republicans plan to investigate the FBI and Justice Department--if conservatives retake the house--for political bias. In a glimpse of what's to come, House Judiciary Committee Republicans warned the FBI and Department of Justice that they plan to investigate both agencies if their party retakes the House of Representatives. And on Friday they released a 1,000-page report about whistleblower accounts of \"a rampant culture of unaccountability, manipulation, and abuse at the highest level.\" Republicans will more than likely retake the House, and possibly the Senate, with the party heavily favored to win midterm elections in several congressional districts. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland , who heads the DOJ, and another to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting documents pertaining to committee investigations lurking in the not-too-distant future. The report , titled FBI Whistleblowers: What Their Disclosures Indicate About the Politicization of the FBI And Justice Department , alleges political corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, according to a House Judiciary Republicans press release. Republicans assert in the report that whistleblowers have brought to their attention, \"allegations of political bias by the FBI's senior leadership and misuses of the agency's federal law-enforcement powers.\" The report, while primarily focused on the FBI, also targets the Justice Department as well. In response to a request for comment on the letter and the report, the FBI told NPR that it has testified to Congress and responded to letters from legislators on numerous occasions to ensure there is an accurate account of their work. It went on to say that its members are dedicated to protecting Americans against terrorism, violent crime and other dangers, all without a political agenda. \"Put quite simply: we follow the facts without regard for politics,\" the FBI said in a written statement. \"While outside opinions and criticism often come with the job, we will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead, do things by the book, and speak through our work.\" The DOJ told NPR it declined to comment on the matter. Both letters and the report come mere days before the close of the 2022 midterm elections, touching on a handful of Republican hot button issues, including but not limited to: domestic violent extremism; allegations against President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden; and the FBI raid on former-President Trump's home where agents seized classified documents, which have become the subject of an ongoing legal battle . Jordan and the committee Republicans accuse the FBI of, \"artificially inflating and manipulating domestic violent extremism statistics for political purposes,\" in their report, claiming that the bureau is, \"fueling the Biden Administration's narrative that domestic violent extremism is the biggest threat to our nation.\" The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a Strategic Intelligence Assessment and Data on Domestic Terrorism report in October, which asserts that domestic violent extremists represent one of the most persistent threats to the country. The report listed more than 30 incidents from 2020 and 2021 it categorized as significant cases of domestic terrorism incidents. \"These individuals are often radicalized online and look to conduct attacks with easily accessible weapons,\" the report reads. \"Many of these violent extremists are motivated and inspired by a mix of ideological, socio-political and personal grievances against their targets.\" According to the report, anti-government or anti-authority and racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism accounted for 77% of the FBI's domestic terrorism investigations in 2020 and 57% in 2021. And, a significant portion of the investigations from 2021 were directly related to the January 2021 siege at the Capitol, the report noted.

In one case, you respect the competition. The team we went up against this year, the pitching was amazing from the rotation into the bullpen.

Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cSo, back to the drawing board.\u201d How the Yankees will spend their offseason trying to close that gap remains to be seen. Both Cashman and manager Aaron Boone pointed to key injuries \u2014 to DJ LeMahieu, Andrew Benintendi, Michael King, Chad Green and Scott Effross, among others \u2014 that kept the Yankees from being the best version of themselves against the Astros. They both also lauded the Astros\u2019 pitching staff, which Boone said was \u201cas healthy and deep\u201d as any team\u2019s heading into the postseason. In the ALCS, Astros pitchers limited the Yankees to just nine runs on 21 hits and 50 strikeouts across four games. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to beat them,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI said we need to slay that dragon, we haven\u2019t done it yet. That hurts. It\u2019s also a motivating factor to try to continue to get better and work.\u201d But Boone insisted that the Yankees are not far from being able to achieve that goal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been knocking on that door now for a long time,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t punched through.

A painting stolen from Staten Island\u2019s Historic Richmond Town decades ago has miraculously found its way home to the museum \u2014 more than half a century later. One morning in November 1970, a portrait of Revolutionary Era figure Ann Totten \u2014 a prominent Staten Island local \u2014 was discovered missing, along with other items, after staff noticed a window in one of the campus\u2019s buildings was forced open. After a flurry of coverage in news outlets like The Post and years of searching once the buzz died down, the painting suddenly turned up \u2014 thousands of miles away \u2014 last October, after a supersleuth and good Samaritan found the coveted lost object about to go up for auction in Northern California . With a lot of help, including FBI intervention, the comely Colonial has now made her way back across the Arthur Kill and will soon take pride of place in her rightful home. \u201cYou just never think that you\u2019re going to see the return of stolen art, especially not 50 years later,\u201d Historic Richmond Town CEO Jessica B. Phillips told The Post. A treasure trove of artifacts lifted from the charming heritage village nestled next to Staten Island\u2019s Greenbelt was uncovered in June of 1971 in a Brooklyn apartment, including a portrait of Totten\u2019s husband, John. Ann, however, painted by artist John Bradley in 1834, remained mysteriously at large for years. After half a century with no luck solving the cold case, Phillips got an unexpected email from astute San Francisco Bay Area collector Gordon Fine last fall, who had visited New York years ago and remembered seeing the portrait of Mr. Totten on display. He also remembered the absence of Ann\u2019s portrait, and that the exhibit catalog noted it had been stolen. All these years later, Fine spotted the piece on his side of the country, about to be sold off by Michaan\u2019s Auctions in San Francisco-adjacent Alameda. He called Staten Island immediately. \u201cThe connecting of the dots is so wild,\u201d said Phillips. Springing into action, Phillips contacted both the FBI\u2019s art crime division and the auction house. Both parties, she said, were more than helpful in returning the portrait of Ann Totten, adding that the bureau hand-delivered the painting back to New York earlier this year after a lengthy investigation. The museum plans a triumphant return of the gussied-up portrait to its galleries next spring. But where exactly was Ann Totten all this time? San Francisco-based art restorer Gregory Gromadzki, who worked on the painting for a client in the late 1990s, has some answers. Gromadzki told The Post that the piece was first brought to him by a mysterious couple who wanted about $500 worth of fixes done. He remembers they were planning to move out of the area. \u201cIt was badly damaged. There was a big, big rip through the image of the lady in her face,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we did fix it and tried to return the painting to them. They said, \u2018Yes, yes, yes, we will pick up the painting.\u2019 They didn\u2019t get back to us. Finally, they disappeared altogether.\u201d Since then, Totten had been cooling her heels in Gromadzki\u2019s storage unit until last autumn, when he decided to bring her to auction. At the end of the day, he was glad to give it back at no cost. \u201cIf the museum enjoys the painting, and the public enjoys the painting, that\u2019s a reward,\u201d he said.", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [4.273474216461182, 2.9453446865081787]}, {"title": "John Fetterman insists he\u2019s been \u2018transparent\u2019 about health in \u2018cakewalk\u2019 \u2018View\u2019 interview", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/04/john-fetterman-says-hes-transparent-about-health-in-view-interview/", "description": "Fetterman appeared remotely on the ABC gabfest with the assistance of a closed-captioning monitor as a series of new polls show him trailing Republican opponent Dr. Mehmet Oz for the first time.", "content": "Pennsylvania Lt.

Former \"Selling Sunset\" star Christine Quinn is living in a Barbie world. Quinn recently revealed her blonde hair and overall styling choices are part of her larger goal to look like the popular doll. Quinn explained she has always been interested in skin care, makeup and hair since she was a teenager, noting she would often do not only her own hair and makeup, but also her friends'. That love of creating an aesthetic has followed her into adulthood with a goal to always look like a version of Barbie. \"It's always some variation of a Barbie, you know, whether it's golf Barbie, or it\u2019s Sharon Stone Barbie, whatever Barbie it may be at that point in time,\" she told Allure.

(Filmdigitals/Mega/GC Images) \"It has just this flawless aesthetic that I always strive to.\" Part of achieving the Barbie aesthetic is the platinum blonde hair, something Quinn has been able to achieve by bleaching her hair since she was 14. She admitted this caused damage to her hair and took a lot of time, especially while working on \"Selling Sunset,\" leading her to find another way to get the same look. \"I have such a love-hate relationship with my blonde hair. I've been bleaching my hair for years, since I was probably 14 or 15 \u2026 and with that comes damage,\" Quinn explained. \"With 'Selling Sunset,' when I was shooting, we were doing my hair every day, if not two times a day. And so it just became a lot. And then I discovered high-lift color, and I've been doing that ever since then.\" When she was younger, Quinn said she got good at bleaching and dying her own hair, along with knowing how to style it and would even highlight and color her friends' hair. She was always trying to keep up with trends, recalling the trend of putting Wet \u2018n Wild eyeliner on the waterline of her eyes. Her passion for doing her own makeup has continued in her adult life. Quinn said she sometimes will still create her own look for major events and red carpets, like Paris Fashion Week . Quinn revealed she sometimes does her own hair and makeup when attending red carpet events. (Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images) \"That's something that I still kind of carry out to this day. Even when I was at Fashion Week recently, I did 90% of my own makeup, and I did my hair probably a few times because I still love to do it,\" she explained. \"There's nothing like doing it yourself if you know the look that you want to achieve.\" As someone whose aesthetic is so important to her, Quinn is ready to try anything when it comes to keeping herself looking youthful. Although she \"can't do anything about'\" getting older, she \"thank(s) God for Botox and fillers\" for helping her through the process.

Despite miscues like those, Cashman defended Boone, who signed a three-year extension a year ago. \u201cHis process is good,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said at Yankee Stadium on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s really good. And he\u2019s not afraid to deal with the obvious in the biggest market, which is talking through it to the best of his abilities when they don\u2019t work out. But I support him 110 percent.\u201d These days, i t\u2019s Cashman who doesn\u2019t have a contract , but the longtime GM seems secure in his position, meaning the tandem is almost certain to be intact for at least one more year. It\u2019s not surprising when you consider the Yankees have made the playoffs in all five of their seasons together, but the franchise still hasn\u2019t been to the World Series since 2009. \u201cWhen you have success, there\u2019s less second-guessing and when you have failure, there\u2019s a lot of second-guessing,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said. \u201cYou can pick apart anybody at any time.\u201d Houston\u2019s Dusty Baker and Philadelphia\u2019s Rob Thomson certainly have raised some eyebrows occasionally on their respective paths to the World Series. Cashman made it clear that he has no issues with how Boone \u2014 or his coaching staff \u2014 approaches the game. \u201cI do not question his process,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said of Boone. \u201cI do not question his commitment with his staff and being in the best position they possibly can to make in-game decisions. They\u2019re not easy. They\u2019re really difficult as the ebbs and flows of these innings play out and what\u2019s available for you that day. I certainly believe in Aaron Boone and know he\u2019s paid to make difficult decisions on the run. I know a lot goes into them. Every one he makes, am I going to agree with? The answer\u2019s obviously not going to be yes. But I know I\u2019m certainly not capable of managing a major league team. There\u2019s very few people that are. I think he\u2019s really good at it.\u201d He also admires Boone\u2019s ability and willingness to deal with the scrutiny that comes with the job. \u201cAlso it comes with the territory, being able to take the criticism or standing up and talking about why you make the decisions you make,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said. Repeatedly throughout Cashman\u2019s press conference, which followed Boone\u2019s, the GM pointed to injuries to key personnel as a main reason why the Yankees followed up a red-hot first half with a disappointing second half and postseason. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a great demeanor and rapport with his players and when we were firing on all cylinders and healthy, we were tough to beat,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said. \u201cIt was fun to watch. Then, along the way, at the worst time possible \u2014 August and September \u2014 the wheels started falling off with injuries. Timing is everything. So that changes the equation and ultimately we didn\u2019t get as far as we\u2019d hoped with the entire crew we wanted. But [Boone] never wavered and his staff never wavered in, \u2018How can we figure this out?\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019ll find a way.\u2019 \u201d For Boone\u2019s part, he said he wasn\u2019t concerned about his future following the playoff exit and is satisfied with how he and his staff work together. \u201cI am comfortable with our process, with my process,\u2019\u2019 Boone said. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly trying to evaluate that and trying to be better at it and trying to grow at it. I think I\u2019ve done that and we\u2019ve done that. \u2026 I think we\u2019re a very well-run and buttoned up organization that is very prepared at what we do.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-18.216299057006836, -16.96938133239746]}, {"title": "Nets, ADL ask for anti-Semitic film in Kyrie Irving controversy be removed from Amazon", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/04/nets-adl-ask-for-anti-semitic-film-in-kyrie-irving-controversy-be-removed-from-amazon/", "description": "The Anti-Defamation League, along with the Nets, have sent a letter to Jeff Bezos asking to have the film and book at the center of the Kyrie Irving controversy removed from Amazon.", "content": "The Anti-Defamation League, along with the Nets, have sent a letter to Jeff Bezos and other leaders at Amazon asking to have the film and book at the center of the Kyrie Irving controversy removed from the platform or at the very least have an explanation added about the issues with the content, according to The Athletic . \u201cHebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America,\u201d a 2018 film based off a 2015 book of the same name, is laced with anti-Semitic tropes and advances the false thesis that black people are the \u201cchosen ones\u201d from Israel and have been victimized by Jews.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Minnesota was traditionally a blue state but has become more purple over the years. Rural Minnesota has grown more Republican while Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs have become more Democratic, along with certain regional centers including Rochester and Duluth. Joe Biden won Minnesota by just over 7 percentage points in 2020 after Donald Trump came within 1.5 points in 2016. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s bid for a second term is Minnesota\u2019s top race this year. He\u2019s up against Republican challenger Scott Jensen, a family practice physician and former state senator. Walz pulled nearly 54 percent of the vote in 2018, when he won by over 11 points, but the race is seen as tighter this year. Jensen has attacked Walz for his handling of the pandemic and the rise in crime following the unrest that erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. The U.S. House race in Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District has drawn the most attention and money of the state\u2019s eight congressional races. It has shaped up as one of the most expensive in the country when outside spending is factored in. Democratic U.S Rep. Angie Craig is fighting to keep her seat in a rematch against Marine Corps veteran Tyler Kistner. Craig beat him by just over 2 points in 2020, and the suburban district remained almost evenly divided along party lines after redistricting. Minnesota\u2019s other closely watched congressional race is in southern Minnesota\u2019s GOP-leaning 1st District, which features another rematch. Republican Brad Finstad is trying to keep the seat he won over Democrat Jeff Ettinger in August to fill out the remainder of the term of GOP U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, who died of kidney cancer in February. The rest of the state\u2019s congressional races are viewed as safe for the incumbents. Minnesota also features a hard-fought attorney general\u2019s race. Democratic incumbent Keith Ellison, who led the prosecution team that got former police Officer Derek Chauvin convicted of murdering Floyd, is seeking a second term over Republican Jim Schultz. All 201 seats in the Minnesota Legislature are on the ballot. Senate Republicans and House Democrats hold narrow majorities, and there are enough competitive races in both chambers for control to shift. Turnout will be the key in Minnesota. Democrats are hoping the fight over abortion rights will drive their voters to the polls in high numbers. Republicans are counting on concerns over crime and the economy to motivate their supporters. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night: Election Night Polls close at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET). How Minnesota Votes The mode of voting for Minnesotans changed in the 2020 election, in part due to COVID-19 concerns , with about 57% voting with no-excuse vote-by-mail or absentee ballots. The rest of the state\u2019s voters did go to the polls that year. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a news conference on Jan. 26, 2021, in St. Paul, Minnesota. Walz is up for reelection this year against Republican challenger Scott Jensen. (AP) As of 2021, Minnesota has dropboxes for mail and absentee ballots. Generally speaking, voters tend to favor paying a visit to their polling place instead of getting a mail/absentee ballot. Voters can vote early in-person or through the mail. You can also register to vote at your polling place on Election Day. The key counties are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, which holds the majority of the state\u2019s population and is mostly dominated by Democrats. However, some of the suburban metro counties are a blend of GOP and Democratic voters. Republicans have gained ground in southern Minnesota and have a strong hold on the northern and western parts of the state, aside from the Duluth area. Minnesota counts its ballots on election night, and those figures include mail/absentee ballots, which must be returned by Election Day. Aside from the closest of races, it\u2019s likely that most of Minnesota\u2019s races will be called on election night. Decision Notes AP will tabulate and declare winners in 189 contested elections in Minnesota, including four statewide races and eight U.S. House races. In the 2020 general election, AP first reported results at 9:08 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 3 and 100% of results at 8:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Nov. 4. AP does not make projections or name apparent or likely winners. Only when AP is fully confident a race has been won \u2013 defined most simply as the moment a trailing candidate no longer has a path to victory \u2013 will we make a call. Should a candidate declare victory \u2013 or offer a concession \u2013 before AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that AP has not yet declared a winner and explain the reason why we believe the race is too early or too close to call. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a potential recount to change the outcome. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2% or if the leading candidate is within 2% of the 50% runoff threshold. AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. What Else Should I Know? Q: What Did We Learn From the Primary? A: Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar only narrowly won her Minneapolis-area primary in a race where crime and policing were the hot issues, but she\u2019s expected to easily win the general election in her heavily Democratic district. Still, her performance raised questions about whether urban progressives will be motivated to vote in large numbers, which has been a key to Democratic success in Minnesota. Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: Some of the temporary measures to make voting easier and safer amid the pandemic have expired, but voting remains easy in Minnesota. Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: According to figures from Minnesota's secretary of state, 2.6 million people voted in the 2018 midterms, which included a gubernatorial race; there were nearly 639,000 absentee and mail ballots. The overall turnout figure jumped to 3.29 million in 2020 for the presidential election, and in part due to COVID-19, about 1.9 million of those ballots were absentee and mail and 1.38 million were submitted at a polling place on Election Day. As of Oct. 20, the secretary of state\u2019s office says almost 468,000 voters have applied for mail and absentee ballots for the midterm election and that 172,520 were returned by Oct. 20. That would indicate that turnout may be closer to 2018 midterm figures. Mail ballots from domestic voters and overseas voters must be returned by Election Day to be counted. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: The state had 100% of precincts reporting by 8:49 p.m. the day after the 2020 election. Q: What Are the Pitfalls With Early Returns? A: Minnesota does not have early returns. All absentee and mail ballots are counted on the day of the election. Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: Minnesota does not have a mandatory recount law for offices, only for ballot measures.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Michigan has been a divided state the past four years with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and a GOP-controlled statehouse. Democrats hope to gain an advantage in at least one of the chambers in the midterm elections, buoyed by redistricting after the 2020 Census that was handled for the first time by a nonpartisan commission. Other top races include Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel running against Kalamazoo lawyer Matthew DePerno, and Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson against former community college professor Kristina Karamo. Both Republican challengers are 2020 election deniers. Michigan lost a U.S. House seat coming out of the Census but still has three of its 13 districts drawing national attention. STEPHEN COLBERT WALKS BACK TUDOR DIXON SWIPE, THEN RIDICULES MICHIGAN VOTER SHE REFERRED TO Elsewhere on the ballot, a proposed constitutional amendment would negate a 91-year-old state law banning abortion in all instances except to save the life of the mother. A record number of people \u2014 over 750,000 \u2014 signed petitions to put the measure on the ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Another ballot question asks whether Michigan should expand opportunities to vote, including through absentee and early voting. The measure would require state-funded absentee ballot drop boxes, as well as postage for absentee ballots and applications, and allow voters to join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. It also would allow Michigan voters to verify their identity with a signed statement or a photo ID, and it would require nine days of in-person early voting.

Gretchen Whitmer, above, speaks at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Sept. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night: Election Night Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone and closes at 8 p.m. ET. Four counties are in the Central Time Zone and do not close until 9 p.m. ET. The AP will not make any race calls in Michigan before 9 p.m. ET. How Michigan Votes A record-breaking 3.3 million people in Michigan voted absentee in the 2020 presidential election at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. State elections officials have said to expect about 2.25 million absentee ballots submitted if trends continue. The more than 5.5 million people who voted in Michigan\u2019s presidential election was the most ever and the highest percentage of voting-age residents to cast a ballot in 60 years. A 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment that allowed for no-excuse absentee voting, in addition to the pandemic, has led voters in the state to increasingly vote absentee rather than at the polls on Election Day. Counties to watch will be the four most populous: Wayne, which includes Detroit; suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb; and Kent in western Michigan where Grand Rapids, the state\u2019s second-largest city is located. Decision Notes The AP is counting votes and declaring winners in more than 160 contested races, including six statewide: governor, secretary of state, attorney general, Supreme Court and three ballot measures, along with U.S. House, state Senate and state House. The AP does not make projections and will only declare a winner when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. Should a candidate declare victory or offer a concession before the AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that the AP has not declared a winner and explain why. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a mandatory recount to change the outcome. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2%. The AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. What Else Should I Know? Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: Clerks can only begin processing the returned ballots the Sunday before Election Day under anagreement reached by Whitmer and the Republican-controlled Legislature. Clerks are allowed to remove absentee ballots from their outer envelopes but still can\u2019t remove secrecy sleeves or count votes until 7 a.m. on Election Day. Delays in results in Michigan, which has one of themost decentralized election systemsin the country, hasleft room for the spread of misinformation in the past. Many clerks have argued that the change will do little good in speeding up the count. Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: Two weeks ahead of Election Day, more than 1.8 million absentee ballots had been requested by voters and 771,967 absentee ballots have been submitted. A record-breaking 3.3 million people in Michigan voted absentee in the 2020 presidential election at the height of the pandemic. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: First results are expected at 8:15 p.m. ET. In the 2020 election, AP reported 94% of results on election night. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Q: What Are the Pitfalls With Early Returns? A: Heavily Democratic voting Detroit and Wayne County, where Detroit is located, are the most populous city and county in the state and often among the latest to post final results, which can eat into or even erase Republican leads. Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: Michigan has a mandatory recount if the difference is 2,000 votes or less. It does not apply in races with more than one winner. Under state law, if the board of county canvassers fails to certify the results of any election for any officer or proposition by the 14th day after the election, the board of county canvassers must deliver to the state board of canvassers all records pertaining to the election. The state canvassers must certify the results within 10 days following the receipt of the records.

According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Texas' mail ballot rejection rate during the 2020 general election was 0.8% and it was 1.5% in 2018. The surge in the rejection rate in March followed a voting law passed by Republicans in the state legislature in 2021 that created new ID requirements for mail ballots. Local officials said confusion created by the law, known as Senate Bill 1, tripped up many voters. In many cases, voters completely missed the field on the ballot return envelope that requires either a partial Social Security number or driver's license number. According to the Texas secretary of state's office, however, the ongoing general election isn't experiencing the same high rate of ballot rejections so far. State officials have reported that 1.78% of mail ballots returned to county election officials have been rejected so far \u2014 8,771 ballots out of 491,399, as of Friday afternoon. About 314,000 ballots still had to be processed by local officials , according to the secretary of state. Voters have until Election Day on Tuesday to turn in mail ballots. Many ballots that have been flagged for rejection will be remedied before voting ends next week, because SB 1 also created a ballot cure process in Texas. That means voters will have an opportunity to fix their mistakes. Sam Taylor, assistant secretary of state for communications, attributes the decrease in the mail ballot rejection rate to updates to the return ballot in some Texas counties, as well as additional voter information included in mail ballots by local officials. He says various voter education campaigns following the March primary have also helped. Taylor said his office, along with county election officials, focused on educating older voters in the state about new ID requirements. In Texas , voters over 65, voters with disabilities, people out of town and people in jail but not convicted can cast a mail ballot. Taylor also said rejection rates were always likely to improve as \"voters got used to\" the new mail ballot process. \"I think it is moving in the right direction and more education never hurts,\" he said. Harris County \u2014 which is home to Houston, and is the state's most populous and diverse county \u2014 so far has a higher rejection rate than the state average. According to Harris County officials, about 9% of returned mail ballots were flagged with a rejection or exception code, as of Wednesday. Officials said most of those preliminary ballots were flagged specifically with ID issues, which are a result of the state's new voting law. Chris Davis \u2014 the elections supervisor in suburban Williamson County, north of Austin \u2014 reported this week that the rejection rate in his county has hovered around 3 to 4%. He said he thinks some voters \"have a couple of elections under their belt\" under the new rules at this point, so rejection rates are slightly lower. During the March primary, officials there rejected 11.5% of returned mail ballots. \"We are confident that it continues to improve,\" Davis said. \"We are pleased with how smooth things are generally going.\" Voting rights advocates warned state lawmakers that SB 1 would create confusion among voters and lead to a higher rejection rate in the state, even with a ballot cure process in place. Multiple lawsuits have been filed citing the federal Voting Rights Act, but most of the law has largely stayed in effect. Advocates were also particularly worried that this year's general election would actually have more issues than the March primary, because it was expected that turnout would be high. However, so far, early voting turnout in Texas has been significantly lower than 2018 and other recent elections.", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [25.80322265625, 5.530011177062988]}, {"title": "\u2018The Great British Baking Show\u2019 Destroys Another Fast Food Favorite: Spring Rolls", "link": "https://decider.com/2022/11/04/great-british-baking-show-spring-rolls/", "description": "Paul and Prue must be stopped.", "content": "The Great British Baking Show seems to be awfully confused this season. Instead of asking the bakers to, you know, bake, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith keep tasking them with cooking dishes from around the world. We\u2019ve watched them massacre pizza, destroy Mexican cuisine , and completely miss the point of s\u2019mores . This week, the horror continues with Prue\u2019s Spring Roll Technical Challenge. The bakers are asked to make the Asian treat using a method that nods to \u201cPastry Week\u201d rather than the actual techniques favored by Vietnamese and Chinese cooks. The Great British Baking Show \u2018s Spring Roll Technical Challenge is just the latest example of how far the producers have strayed from the path of righteousness. Whatever happened to British bakes on The Great British Baking Show ? At first, The Great British Baking Show \u201cPastry Week\u201d felt like a return to the classics. Paul and Prue asked the five remaining bakers to bake vol-au-vents. Sure, they complicated things by asking for sweet vol-au-vents instead of the typical savory, but vol-au-vents were featured on Bake Off in Mary Berry\u2019s days. This is the stuff The Great British Baking Show does well! (Even if all the bakers, er, struggled a bit with their pastry.) By the time the Technical Challenge came around, though, it was clear that Prue and Paul were merely trolling us. Once again, they had chosen chaos. Instead of a myriad of traditional pies, challenging treats, or fiddly filo dough-based desserts, Prue went with spring rolls. And while I guess they looked fine, they didn\u2019t look right. Nor did Prue\u2019s method for making spring roll wrappers. The majority of spring roll wrapper recipes I found online seem to advocate for either brushing the dough in the pan or swirling a very wet dough in said pan. YouTuber Elaine Luo has a rather mesmerizing video of the latter method and her comments page is a veritable chorus of folks saying this is how their mothers used to make the recipe. What Prue asked the bakers to make, though, looks more like a wonton wrapper dough to me. Hence why the final fried version is covered in so many bubbles. And can we talk about the bubbles? I\u2019m not mad that many of the bakers produced deep fried spring rolls covered in blisters. I\u2019m more confused why the spring rolls that Prue showed Paul to explain the challenge had so many bubbles. What are spring rolls supposed to look like, Prue? How many bubbles are acceptable? Why were yours covered in bubbles? Prue\u2019s idea of a spring roll aside, it soon became evident that none of the bakers were especially comfortable with the challenge. Abdul said his mom made spring rolls all the time, but he hadn\u2019t paid attention. Multiple bakers were flummoxed over Prue\u2019s instruction to chop the \u201cmangetouts.\u201d That is just a fancy person name for sugar peas. Matt Lucas cracked a joke that it would be faster to just run down to the local Chinese restaurant for takeaway. The bakers looked tempted to do just that. Because once again, the issue with these culinary challenges isn\u2019t even the fact that Paul and Prue have their own quirky ways of approaching the dish. (Though that is a problem as they are supposed to be experts.) The issue is that baking and cooking are actually two different skillsets. Many people possess both the ability to bake sourdough bread and rustle up a roast dinner, but very few people are experts at both. I don\u2019t know how many times I have to spell this out, but The Great British Baking Show is supposed to be a baking competition. This recent avalanche of savory dishes that merely shrug towards baking undermines The Great British Baking Show \u2018s thesis statement. Of course Maxy doesn\u2019t know how full her spring rolls are supposed to be! She came here to bake! If I have one single bone to pick with The Great British Baking Show this season, it\u2019s that these gestures at being \u201cdifferent\u201d stop! As the bakers themselves proved in their lackluster Signature and Showstopper Challenges, good baking is hard enough. You don\u2019t need to fling random international street food challenges at them to keep things challenging.

Mike Dunleavy seeks to become the first governor since Democrat Tony Knowles in 1998 to serve back-to-back terms in Alaska. His challengers are former Gov.

Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night: Election Night Polls close at 8 p.m. local time (12 a.m. ET). How Alaska Votes The Nov. 8 election is a ranked choice election, in keeping with a 2020 voter initiative that implemented open primaries and ranked voting for general elections. Election results in many races may not be known until Nov. 23, which is the deadline for elections officials to receive ballots mailed from overseas addresses and when ranked vote tabulations will take place. Under ranked voting, a candidate can win outright if they win more than 50% of the vote in the first round. If no one hits that threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes count for their next choice. Rounds continue until two candidates remain, and whoever has the most votes will win. About half of Alaska voters cast early ballots in the 2020 general election compared to about 30% in 2018. ALASKA CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE: PELTOLA, PALIN, BEGICH AND BYE SQUARE OFF ON INFLATION, GAS PRICES, STUDENT LOANS Decision Notes Vote totals reported Tuesday night will include ballots cast in person that day as well as during early voting from Oct. 24 through Nov. 3. But early voting runs through Election Day, meaning that the figures race callers are looking at in the hours after polls close won't include mail ballots or several days' worth of in-person voting. The AP does not make projections and will only declare a winner when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. Should a candidate declare victory or offer a concession before the AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that the AP has not declared a winner and explain why. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a recount to change the outcome. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2% or if the leading candidate is within 2% of the 50% threshold to trigger ranked choice tabulation. The AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What Else Should I Know? Q: What Did We Learn From the Primary? A: Alaska held an open primary that allowed the top four vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, to advance to the general election. This was only the second primary held in the state under the 2020 voter initiative that overhauled Alaska elections. The first was a June special primary for U.S. House. Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: In 2020, in response to a court challenge, the Alaska Supreme Court eliminated witness signature requirements for absentee ballots. Those requirements are in effect for this year\u2019s elections. Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: By a week before Election Day, 52,821 early ballots had been requested and 16,593 had been returned. Another 13,764 early in-person ballots had been cast. Total voter registration in the state exceeds 600,000. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: Counting tends to be slow in Alaska with definitive results not available in some races for many days after Election Day. Nearly 52% of the votes cast in the 2020 general election weren't counted until after Election Day. Q: What Are the Pitfalls With Early Returns? A: The trends from the early returns can be difficult to interpret since so many ballots are left uncounted until after Election Day. Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: There is a 10-day deadline to receive absentee ballots mailed from within the U.S. and a 15-day deadline to receive absentee ballots mailed from outside the country. Races are reviewed Nov. 23 to determine if candidates received 50% plus 1 vote. If not, ranked choice tabulation begins.

Two Indiana men, Frank Garrison and Noel Johnson, had asked Barrett to stay the program from going into effect while they appeal the dismissal of their initial suit by an Indiana federal judge. Johnson and Garrison, an attorney at the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, had argued that the automatic forgiveness of their student loan debt would cause them irreparable harm by sticking them with a hefty state tax bill. \u201cIn its rush, the administration created new problems for members of the class\u2014borrowers in at least six states that tax loan cancellation as income and who are pursuing debt forgiveness under statutory forgiveness programs like [Public Service Loan Forgiveness],\u201d attorneys Caleb Kruckenberg and Michael Poon wrote in their request for an emergency stay, filed Tuesday. \u201cThese borrowers \u2026 will actually be worse off because of the cancellation,\u201d they added. The lawsuit was rejected by the Indiana judge on the grounds that Johnson and Garrison could not prove their tax burden was \u201ctraceable\u201d to Biden\u2019s loan cancellation program, which has caused an outcry from Republicans and conservatives who say it is both illegal and would worsen decades-high inflation. However, court challenges to the plan have been slow in coming due to difficulty finding plaintiffs who have standing \u2014 that is, an argument that shows they are directly harmed by the action. On Oct. 20, Barrett rejected a request from the Brown County (Wis.) Taxpayers Association to block the program on the ground that it would cost taxpayers billions of dollars. In both cases, Barrett neither commented on the filing, asked the Justice Department to respond, nor referred the matter to her other colleagues. Barrett handles emergency requests arising from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers both Indiana and Wisconsin, as well as Illinois. The day after Barret denied the Wisconsin taxpayers request, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay while it considers a motion from six Republican-led states to block the program. Under Biden\u2019s plan, borrowers are eligible for forgiveness of up to $10,000 in federally owned student debt if they have an annual income under $125,000. Pell Grant recipients are eligible for another $10,000 in forgiveness. About 8 million people were expected to receive the benefits automatically; however, the White House announced soon after Garrison\u2019s initial Sept. 27 lawsuit that borrowers could opt out of the automatic cancellation. \u201cSince this program was first announced, the administration has done everything in its power to avoid judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kruckenberg told The Post in an email. \u201cThus far it has succeeded. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is completely unlawful. We are disappointed by the denial of an emergency injunction, but will continue to fight this program in court.\u201d Biden invoked emergency powers to authorize the loan forgiveness following a pressure campaign from the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing \u2014 who argued the COVID-19 pandemic meant he had a right to waive the debt. However, the president appeared to undercut his own justification for the handout when he said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview Sept. 19 that \u201cthe pandemic is over\u201d \u2014 before any loans actually were forgiven. In a memo justifying the loan forgiveness plan, the Education Department\u2019s legal department cited a 2003 law that allows the president to \u201calleviate hardship\u201d for student loan recipients during a national emergency. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Biden\u2019s plan would cost taxpayers $400 billion, with the additional deferment of payments and interest accrual on student loans through the end of 2022 costing taxpayers another $20 billion. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said the CBO actually underestimated costs because it didn\u2019t account for another part of Biden\u2019s plan that caps repayment on undergraduate loans at 5% of a person\u2019s earnings, down from the current 10%. The group projected in August that the so-called \u201cincome-driven repayment\u201d (IDR) policy would cost taxpayers another $120 billion . The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in August that Biden\u2019s debt cancellation alone would cost $519 billion, while the postponement of payments would cost another $16 billion and the lower repayment rule would cost $70 billion.

Byron Donalds is running to be chair of the House GOP Conference against Rep.

Byron Donalds, a firebrand freshman Republican running what's generally considered a long shot campaign for conference chair, says he wants the House GOP to give more power to its rank-and file members. \"It's one thing when you're voting no against Nancy Pelosi \u2026 that's actually pretty simple because those ideas are just insane,\" Donalds, R-Fla., said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"But going into a majority where we have a responsibility for governing, it's important for every member of the \u2026 conference \u2026 to have their hand in how we run things.\" Donalds announced that he was seeking the post last month and was quickly followed by Stefanik, R-N.Y., who announced she'd seek re-election to the job after the midterms.

It's on Comedy Central, it's on HBO, it's on ESPN and on Fox Sports.\" The expectation among most Republican aides and observers of the conference is that Stefanik likely will win the post by a wide margin. She's spent significant time campaigning for many members, particularly women members, through her E-PAC. And she has the public support of both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. Former President Donald Trump also encouraged Stefanik to return for another term as conference chair, Stefanik previously told Fox News, which could become a factor in the race. But Donalds says his message is connecting with more people than others may expect and is optimistic he can make the secret-ballot race competitive. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., says he wants Republicans to get their message out on more than just the national political media. (Fox News Digital) \"I think that there are a lot of members who are actually open-minded about this race.

Everybody's campaigned hard. And so the members who are duly elected by the people who sent them should be able to have their voices heard.\" Republican Conference Chair Rep.

Donalds is a member of the Freedom Caucus.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Control of the U.S. Senate and House could go directly through Arizona as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly tries to win a full term after nabbing the last two years of the late Sen. John McCain\u2019s seat in 2018. He faces a rough challenge from Republican Blake Masters. Meanwhile, Republicans buoyed by redistricting are eying two, possibly three House seats now held by Democrats. And Republicans backed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 and who back his unfounded claims that he lost because of election fraud \u2014 are hoping to nab the governor\u2019s office, secretary of state and attorney general. Democratic candidates for those offices are campaigning on abortion rights and pushing back hard against the election denialism that GOP candidates have embraced. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night : Election Night Polls close at 7 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET). OFFICIALS WARN OF MIDTERM POLLING SITE INTIMIDATION How Arizona Votes More than 80% of the state\u2019s voters cast ballots early, either by mail or in person at early voting sites. Some of those mail ballots are dropped off at polling places on Election Day. Early ballots received up to a few days before Election Day will be counted and released about an hour after polls close; \"live\" Election Day vote tallies will come in the following hours. So-called \"late-early\" votes will wait for tabulation in the coming days, because all require verification that they were signed by valid registered voters before being counted. GOP candidates, backed by former President Donald Trump, are seeking to control the governor\u2019s seat, attorney general, and secretary of state. Decision Notes AP will tabulate more than 60 contested races in the Arizona general election. U.S. Senate, governor, attorney general, secretary of state and the Change Voter ID ballot proposal are of particular national interest. Other statewide races include nine ballot measures plus treasurer, public instruction and corporation commission. U.S. House Districts 1 through 7 are contested (Districts 8 and 9 are uncontested) along with more than 40 state legislative races. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a mandatory recount to change the outcome. In the 2020 general election, the first results came in just after 8 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), with half of all precincts reporting by 10 p.m. local time (12 a.m. ET). The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2% or if the leading candidate is within 2% of the 50% runoff threshold. AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. FOR THE WIN: CONTROL OF THE SENATE HINGES ON THESE VOLATILE RACES What Else Should I Know? Q: What Did We Learn From the Primary? A: Republicans are no longer embracing early voting as they have in years past, when GOP voters tended to get their mail ballots in earlier than Democrats. Instead, more GOP voters are waiting to drop them off on Election Day at the polls, or opting to vote in person instead. This means early results can flip as later votes are counted. Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: Not much in this election. Arizona has had early voting for three decades, and that changed little in 2020. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: Generally, up to and sometimes longer than a week. Q: What Are the Pitfalls With Early Returns? A: The earliest returns often don\u2019t clearly show who will ultimately win. Waiting for all the Election Day votes to be counted is often needed to see who won, and it is also common for races to be too close to call until a substantial number of the \"late-earlies\" are tabulated in the following days. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: County election officials will start verifying and counting the \"late-early\" ballots, and processing provisional and other ballots that need to be verified. Voters have a week to cure ballots with signatures that don\u2019t match the one on file. Quotable \"When the president decided he\u2019s going to do something dumb on this and change the rules, that would create a bigger crisis, I told him he was wrong.\" \u2014 Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, talking border security during a debate with Republican Blake Masters, highlighting the \"independent Arizonan\" philosophy that has been key for Democratic wins in the state Parting Thoughts A decade of predictions that Arizona would go from deep-red to purple came to pass in 2018 when Kyrsten Sinema won a U.S. Senate seat and again in 2020 when the state\u2019s voters went for Joe Biden over Donald Trump for president and sent a second Democrat, Kelly, to the Senate. Whether those were flukes of timing or personality or a real shift will become more clear after votes from Tuesday\u2019s election are counted.

The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella \"Izzy\" Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family\u2019s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim. NEW US SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE 988 LAUNCHED \"We appreciate the interest on the case, but until we carefully review it and confer with legal counsel, our district will not be able to comment further,\" Chris Williams, spokesperson for the Davis School District, said in a statement after the notice of claim was filed. Tichenor's death in November 2021 sparked massive outcry and a groundswell of anger over youth suicide , bullying and the treatment of children with autism. In Utah, a predominantly white state where incidents of racism in schools frequently make headlines, it prompted state legislators to pass a new law requiring districts to track reported bullying and racism in schools. Brittany Tichenor-Cox, holds a photo of her daughter, Isabella \"Izzy\" Tichenor, during an interview during an interview on Nov. 29, 2021, in Draper, Utah. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) The notice of claim recounts how Tichenor, who was autistic and the only Black student in her class, was bullied by students who said she smelled, made fun of her skin color, eyebrows and used racist slurs against her. It provides a timeline of Tichenor's parents repeatedly alerting the school of bullying in the months leading up to their daughter's death and alleges administrators did not take action to stop it. \"As a result of this unchecked bullying and the school's overall \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to minority students, Izzy failed nearly all her classes.

Sign up here to get early access to more stories about how we're adjusting to a changing world. I got a surprise when I opened Twitter the other morning \u2014 and no, it wasn't because of the latest tweet from new owner Elon Musk . At the top of my feed was a colorful graphic announcing, \"It takes time to count all of the votes.\" It gave a few more details about why (projected winners in some contests might not be announced right away) and a warning: \"This means you could encounter unconfirmed claims that a candidate has won their race.\" Below were two buttons to \"find out more\" and \"learn how voting by mail is safe and secure.\" I immediately recognized what I was seeing: a \"prebunk\" . Twitter is just one of several companies, government agencies and civic groups experimenting with this strategy, which rests on a simple idea: show people a little bit about misleading information, so they're better equipped to recognize and resist it if they encounter it in the future. Think of it like a vaccine against false claims \u2014 in fact, it stems from a field of social psychology research called inoculation theory. The research on just how prebunks work and how long they last is still in the early innings \u2014 and everyone I spoke with about the strategy emphasized it's only one part of the bigger fight to protect elections, and democracy at large, from the corrosive impact of deliberate falsehoods. But companies including Twitter and Google have seen encouraging results, and are putting resources into prebunks \u2014 in Twitter's case for this fall's elections in the U.S. and Brazil , and in Google's case around Europe's refugee crisis. For now, anyway. Because the other thing I immediately thought when I saw that message on Twitter was, how long will this last? Which brings me back to Elon Musk. The world's richest person now owns Twitter , and things are already changing . The site saw a surge in hate speech right after news broke that he'd taken control. Twitter and outside researchers said a coordinated campaign originating on far-right platforms was in part to blame. Trolls egged each other on to post racist slurs and antisemitic memes on Twitter, in an apparent effort to make it seem like Musk had followed through on his promises to loosen the platform's rules against things like abuse, harassment and misleading claims in the name of free speech. Musk says no rules have changed yet and that he won't make any major overhauls \u2014 including reinstating banned users such as former President Donald Trump \u2014 until he sets up a \"content moderation council.\" But as the trolling campaign shows, his ownership is already having an impact. And Musk himself is engaging in his characteristic chaos: one moment pledging to advertisers that Twitter won't become a \"free-for-all hellscape,\" the next tweeting to his 112 million followers a lurid, baseless conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi . (Musk eventually deleted the tweet, but not before it was retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times.) That's left many people \u2014 including people inside Twitter working on trust and safety \u2014 increasingly agitated about the company's willingness and capacity to deal with misleading information about voting and candidates, threats to election workers , and the possibility of premature or false claims of victory. This week, Twitter froze some employee access to content moderation tools, Bloomberg reported . Musk also laid off swaths of employees on Friday, including members of the curation team who tackle misinformation and contextualize news on the platform, according to employees. \"We're still enforcing our rules at scale,\" Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity, tweeted in response to the Bloomberg story. But what happens when the person potentially breaking them is Twitter's owner, CEO and sole director?

And: Will he do so moving forward? There\u2019s no guarantees in terms of health in any of these situations when you make these commitments on players. He\u2019s a fan favorite. He\u2019s respected within that clubhouse. He goes about his business as good as you possibly can. He\u2019s an elite performer and is one of the game\u2019s best, if not the best, player. Those are the type you want to retain and have as long as you possibly can. \u201cUltimately Hal Steinbrenner will collect all the information from the industry standpoint, where people are in free agency \u2014 things can get pretty crazy. Then obviously factor in everything else that are non-baseball related. What drives our fan base, showing up and supporting us. [Steinbrenner] wants to make them happy. \u2026 Hopefully we\u2019ll have some positive conversations that lead to the outcome that we want. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d Whether or not the Yankees can re-sign Judge will dictate the rest of their offseason, so Cashman said it would be \u201coptimal\u201d to get a deal done early. But he admitted that Judge will \u201cdictate the dance steps to his free agency.\u201d If those negotiations do not ultimately bring Judge back to The Bronx, the Yankees would be hard-pressed trying to replace him, especially in an offseason when the next-best free-agent outfielder might be Brandon Nimmo. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is of course I hope he\u2019s back and a Yankee forever,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better guy that you\u2019d want to be leading your team and organization.

He was pummeled and wrestled to the ground.\" \"He wrote these pleading letters to his parents to please take him out of school,\" Andersen claimed to the outlet. \"By today\u2019s standards, it would be akin to hazing or child abuse, frankly, and yet his parents turned a blind eye to it.

The future king followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and attended the school from the age of 13. \"One of the mistakes that were made when Charles arrived at Gordonstoun was that we were all told he was just to be treated like everybody else,\" said John Stonborough. \"But he wasn\u2019t everybody else, was he?

The most important and invested voices in his orbit -- including NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Nets general manager Sean Marks -- had sided with a broad swath of the public in believing that Irving's refusal to condemn the contents of an antisemitic film he shared on his social media had left the Nets no choice but to suspend him, sources told ESPN. Against the backdrop of calls for swift action, sources said Tsai had resisted and insisted on taking time to educate Irving on the horrors of antisemitism. He'd enlisted the counsel of the Anti-Defamation League, watched the full 3\u00bd hours of the hate-filled movie Irving had shared, \"Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America\" -- complete with its Holocaust denialism and quoting of antisemites such as Adolf Hitler and Henry Ford -- and researched the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, whose beliefs Irving frequently references in public settings. As it turned out, the redemptive arc that Tsai had imagined for his star had devolved into what the owner felt was a repetitive exercise in Irving's betrayal of good faith, sources said. For nearly a week, Tsai kept extending the clock to give Irving a chance to get this right for himself, the franchise and the Jewish community -- and Irving never returned a single of his text messages, sources said. Almost a week later, Irving had shown no inclination to deliver an apology, nor a disassociation of the movie's contents, nor a willingness to answer \"No\" when asked if he held antisemitic beliefs. The team Thursday leveled a five-game suspension without pay, declaring Irving \"currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets.\" For all the questions surrounding the most troubling week in the troubled tenure of Irving and the Nets, one question remained: Why did it take Tsai so long to get there? As much as anything, Tsai had held out a hope that there could be a two-way conversation with Irving. Tsai issued a statement Friday night, declaring he was \"disappointed that Kyrie appears to support a film based on a book full of antisemitic disinformation,\" and described his desire to \"sit down and make sure he understands this is hurtful to all of us, and as a man of faith, it is wrong to promote hate based on race, ethnicity or religion.\" After a combative news conference Saturday night in which Irving said he refused to \"stand down,\" stronger calls had emerged within Nets leadership and the commissioner's office to level a suspension, sources said. For the franchise and league, embarrassment grew and patience waned. For most, the news conference had portrayed a familiar Irving -- defiant, undeterred and crusading with misinformation. \"I'm only going to get stronger because I'm not alone,\" Irving said. \"I have a whole army around me.\" This stirred the echoes of Irving's anti-science, anti-vaccination stance of a season ago. Much of the Nets' standoff with Irving, 30, in the offseason had been rooted in the franchise's unwillingness to guarantee the 2011 No. 1 overall draft pick a long-term contract, leaving him in the final season of his deal at a $36.5 million salary. The failed negotiations of the summer had spilled into a far more dramatic and destructive matter this time. The franchise's communication with Irving had been channeled completely through his agent and stepmother, Shetellia Riley Irving, sources said. Tsai had wanted time and space to work together with the ADL and Irving, but there was no direct dialogue with Irving himself, sources said. Silver had cautioned Tsai that issuing a joint statement with the ADL without dealing with Irving directly -- nor including a condemnation of the movie's material, or a full apology -- simply didn't reach an acceptable threshold, sources said. The Nets and Irving on Wednesday publicly pledged $500,000 each to the ADL for the purposes of combating antisemitism, only to have ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt publicly declare hours later -- and following news of Irving's suspension -- that the group would no longer accept the donation after Irving's \"debacle\" of a news conference Thursday. Silver's patience had run out Thursday morning. What had started as a humiliation for the Nets had become a full-scale embarrassment and crisis for the league. Silver issued a piercing condemnation of Irving's failure to offer \"an unqualified apology and more specifically denounce the vile and harmful content contained in the film he chose to publicize.\" Irving had become an albatross around his team, too. He had played a listless game Tuesday in a loss to the Chicago Bulls, leaving his teammates and opponents to privately describe him as disengaged and seemingly \"in another world.\" For a player averaging 30 points and shooting at almost every opportunity, Irving didn't make a basket until the fourth quarter. He had been distant to everyone in recent days, sources said, his presence feeling like an anvil hanging over everyone. Before the Nets on Thursday took off for a weekend trip to play the Washington Wizards and the Charlotte Hornets, Irving had walked over to an assembled group of media members and again refused to apologize or condemn the film. Asked if he held antisemitic beliefs, Irving responded, \"I cannot be antisemitic if I know where I come from.\" For Tsai, that was it. No more. Irving's refusal to disavow antisemitism and Holocaust denial convinced him Irving had been insincere in his joint ADL statement hours earlier, sources said. The efforts to educate had failed miserably, Tsai's faith in Irving proving once more to have been misguided and ultimately disastrous for his franchise. The only question left for Tsai and the Nets: How long of a suspension for Irving, and what would be the path to reinstatement? After hours of conferring with lawyers and the league office, the Nets landed on five games without pay -- costing Irving $1.2 million -- and a requirement to complete a \"series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct.\" In an email outlining the suspension to his agent, the conditions needed for Irving's reinstatement included a public statement recognizing the film is antisemitic, an apology for supporting the film and the falsehoods within it, and training sessions on the dangers of hate speech, sources said. There would also need to be meetings with Brooklyn Jewish leaders, Marks told reporters Friday morning. Four hours after learning of his suspension, Irving issued a statement on his Instagram page that went further than he had gone in the previous week. \"To all Jewish families and communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize,\" Irving wrote. \"I initially reacted out of emotion to being unjustly labeled Antisemitic, instead of focusing on the healing process of my Jewish Brothers and Sisters that were hurt from the hateful remarks made in the documentary.\" Marks on Friday called the apology a \"step in the right direction\" but \"certainly not enough.\" Amid the suspension, the Nets are in freefall. They have lost six of their first eight games to start the season. Besides the Irving situation, Ben Simmons is out with knee soreness and the Nets are still working through the final stages of vetting the hiring of suspended Celtics coach Ime Udoka, sources said. As usual, Irving's future is murky and tied to Kevin Durant's. If Irving's trade value was low this summer, it has cratered now. Even so, the Nets needed a trade partner willing to give Irving a long-term deal to execute a trade over the summer, but that's no longer the case. He's on an expiring contract, which means a team isn't committed financially to him beyond the end of this season. Four years ago, Durant and Irving arrived in Brooklyn together. The partnership nearly crumbled over the summer and now teeters again. When talking to reporters Friday morning, Durant was noncommittal on Irving, the organization and the chaos of the entire week. \"I feel like it was all unnecessary,\" he said.

How Delaware Votes Two years ago, Democrats won the state's presidential, Senate and U.S. House contests by double digits. In that 2020 general election, just under a third of all ballots cast were absentees. Decision Notes The AP is tabulating the at-large U.S. House seat, attorney general, state treasurer, state auditor and all legislative races. The AP does not make projections and will only declare a winner when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. Should a candidate declare victory or offer a concession before the AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that the AP has not declared a winner and explain why. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a potential recount to change the outcome. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2%. AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. What Else Should I Know? Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: The state passed laws this year allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration, but the Delaware Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional last month. DELAWARE SUPREME COURT RULES VOTE-BY-MAIL, SAME-DAY REGISTRATION LAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: Delaware counts quickly. In the 2020 general election, AP first reported results at 8:16 p.m. ET and 90% of results by 10:15 p.m. Officials can start counting absentee ballots the Friday before Election Day but can\u2019t release those counts until after polls close. Q: What Happens After Tuesday? A: Candidates for statewide offices can request a recount if the margin is the lesser of 1,000 votes or half of 1% of votes cast. For legislative and county races, those same margins trigger an automatic recount.

Vermont voters this Election Day could choose the first woman to serve in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. In what some see as an anomaly in deep-blue Vermont , the state is the only one in the country that has never sent a woman or a member of a minority group to represent it in Congress. But in Tuesday\u2019s voting, Democratic state Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint, a former teacher who would be the first openly gay person to represent Vermont, is the leading candidate in the race for the state\u2019s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. VERMONT TO CHOOSE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES, INCLUDING SUCCESSOR TO LAST 'WATERGATE BABY,' SEN. PATRICK LEAHY Vermont\u2019s current member of the U.S. House, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, is the leading candidate to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy . In the governor\u2019s race, Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott is seeking a fourth, two-year-term. Vermonters will also vote on whether to amend the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights. Vermont is likely to send state senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint to Congress, replacing incumbent Peter Welch, who will likely win the Senate seat vacated by Patrick Leahy. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect on election night: Election Night Polls close at 7 p.m. ET. How Vermont Votes There are some 500,000 registered voters in Vermont, with about 445,000 of them active. All active Vermont voters will be sent a general election ballot that must be returned no later than poll close on election night, 7 p.m. ET. Vermonters can check their registration status on the My Voter Page but for official information, residents must check with the clerk in their town of residence. Early and absentee voting is open to everyone and begins no later than 45 days before Election Day. Voters can mail their ballots with the recommendation they are sent by Oct. 31 to ensure they are received in time. Voters may also deposit their ballot into a drop box or bring them in person to their hometown or clerk\u2019s office. They can also drop off ballots on Election Day at their polling location. Considered a blue state, Vermont has kept its Democratic incumbents in Congress but is balanced by a GOP governor. Since Vermonters like their incumbents, this year will be interesting because Leahy is retiring and Vermont will pick a new senator for the first time since Bernie Sanders came into office. SEN. PATRICK LEAHY TAKEN TO HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON 'AS A PRECAUTION' AFTER NOT FEELING WELL Decision Notes Unlike most states, Vermont, along with other New England states, reports vote counts at the town or ward level rather than at the county level and provides only one report on election night. That delays calling close races and races with multiple winners in state Senate races. It can also make some statewide races harder to call until there is enough representation throughout the state. Typically, reports begin to arrive by 7:15 pm ET and remain steady until late evening. Less than 1% of the count remains to be reported the following day and is usually done by early afternoon. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a recount to change the outcome. There are no mandatory recount laws. However, nonmandatory recounts are allowed at the request of a candidate if the vote count is within a tight margin; a candidate cannot request a recount of a portion of the state. To petition for a recount for a federal, statewide, county or state Senate race, the difference between the loser and winner \u2014 divided by the total votes cast for all candidates, then divided by the number of persons to be elected \u2014 must be less than 2%. For state House races, the result must be less than 5%. For general elections, candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and treasurer must receive a majority of votes, meaning a candidate must receive 50% of votes cast plus one vote to be elected. If no majority is received, the state Senate and House will elect the winner. Tie votes in local races will result in runoffs. Races with too few votes and not enough of a margin or vote difference will remain uncalled. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2% or if the leading candidate is within 2% of the 50% runoff threshold. The AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome. What Else Should I Know? Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: The state is using essentially the same electoral system in 2022 that was in place for the 2020 election. It includes a system that now allows voters to \"cure\" defective ballots, such as when voters don\u2019t properly follow the proper procedures. The voter is notified by the town or city clerk within three days of receipt of the defective ballot, giving the voter the opportunity to fix it so it can be counted. Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: In 2018, 26% of voters cast early absentee/advance ballots. In 2020, advance voting jumped to 76%. Advance votes are reported with Election Day votes in a single report by the local clerk. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take?

It usually goes like this. A school will receive an anonymous call or is tipped off to a social media post threatening a shooting. The investigation could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. But until schools are given the all-clear, these threats are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing in terms of the emotional and psychological impact. In the past few months, schools across the United States have been experiencing just this scenario, and the trend doesn\u2019t seem to be letting up. The National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO), has tracked at least 60 instances of fake school shooting threats or hoaxes \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u201cswatting\u201d \u2013 across 30 states and Washington, D.C., since September. \u201cWhile nationwide statistics on these criminal events are not readily available, in 2013 one FBI official estimated that hundreds were occurring each year including locations other than schools. Open-source reporting indicates a recent surge of \u2018swatting\u2019 calls targeting schools in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia,\u201d NASRO said in a September 26 statement. As recently as Tuesday, a false report of multiple people being shot forced a Sacramento high school on lockdown for several hours. While fake school shooting threats and swatting incidents do not claim any lives, they can cause long-lasting trauma for the students and teachers who experience them, particularly if they or someone they know has experienced the real thing. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing anytime you have a false alarm, but especially now with students coming off of being out of the classroom for an extended period of time due to the pandemic,\u201d NASRO director of operations Mac Hardy told Fox News Digital. \u201cThat is so unhealthy to a child because when you have that alarm, it sends your body into a fight-or-flight situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they see on the news, they\u2019re seeing people their age being shot and that fear just amplifies the words they\u2019re hearing.\u201d George Roberts, a superintendent at Baltimore County who has experienced a real school shooting, said threats can be \u201cvery traumatic\u201d for students. \u201cIt could weigh on children who don\u2019t have the cognitive abilities to go, \u2018OK, this is just someone doing something very inappropriate. We know we\u2019re going to be OK because of the measures put in place,'\u201d he said. Aside from the psychological impact on a child , fake threats and hoaxes can be a drain on law enforcement resources, particularly in rural communities. \u201c[If] you think about a rural school, and the county has maybe six or seven deputies on duty at a single time, and you have an incident that occurs at your high school in that county, then it could be every deputy that they have at that scene,\u201d Hardy said. While there has been a common thread among the profile of school shooters, fake school shooting threats do not reflect any discernible pattern. In some incidents, the calls originated from outside the state and even outside the country. In other cases, a student was trying to get out of a test or simply wanted to cause mayhem without grasping the long-term consequences. Roberts said he has seen threats spike around the anniversaries of major school shootings, such as the 10-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting next month. \u201cYou get those bad actors, those folks who just want to come out and send threats through email or via phone or the internet,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cYou see the incidents of increased swatting when you get close to significant yearly recognitions of Columbine, Sandy Hook [or] Parkland, being just three of the major ones.\u201d Both Hardy and Roberts stressed the importance of treating each threat as if it were real and for schools to never let down their guard. \u201cWhen we move to it, we\u2019ve got to move to it as if it were a real threat and then determine if it\u2019s real and relay that information back as quickly as possible,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cWe cannot become complacent and change our protocol to \u2018we\u2019ll respond when we determine that it\u2019s a real call.\u2019 That to me becomes another dangerous situation.\u201d \u201cThere should not be any atrophy. There should not be any letting your guard down in situations like this by law enforcement or by educators,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt does get very tiring, and it does get very taxing \u2026 you\u2019re paying educators, and you\u2019re paying educators to do things that in the end may not be credible, but it just takes one time.\u201d Roberts stressed communication between police, schools and the community as the key factor in mitigating threats both credible and non-credible. When police investigate threats and are transparent about what happened, it \u201cpermeates within the community at large,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIn many cases, it will cut down on the number of kids or young adults who think it\u2019s funny because they know that chances of them getting caught are greater,\u201d Roberts said. Would-be instigators, Roberts said, are usually dissuaded from carrying out a threat if they see news reports detailing another threat and how police handled the situation. \u201cThat lets the potential bad actors know that unless you really, really want to take that risk, if you really, really want to take that chance, the chances of you getting caught are pretty high,\u201d he said.", "date": "2022-11-04", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [7.386492729187012, 9.135819435119629]}, {"title": "Inside a listed Beverly Hills home that\u2019s lovingly stuck in the \u201860s", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/04/inside-a-listed-beverly-hills-home-thats-stuck-in-the-60s/", "description": "This sumptuous California home is stuck in the 20th century and looking for its second-ever owner.", "content": "It\u2019s still the swinging \u201960s in this groovy Beverly Hills abode.

She lived there until she was 99 years old and she was very proud of the house she built,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a terrific woman.\u201d Located a few blocks north of the Beverly Hills Hotel, the midcentury estate is not \u201cmassive,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut it is completely unique in the finest sense of the term.\u201d The gem comes with Paul Ferrante finishes, Dexter Frankel sculptures, Edward Fields carpets and is set on a slightly less than half-acre lot. The yard offers a patio and a pool with a diving platform. The home itself measures in at just under 4,000 square feet. Listing images additionally show interiors with handsome wood-paneled walls, floor-to-ceiling exposures, ornate period-specific wallpaper \u2014 such as a plaid pattern in a bedroom \u2014 and a mod-looking fireplace. The home has even generated buzz among other real estate professionals in the area. \u201cYou can tell a lot about a person by the way they keep a house and I knew immediately that I loved this lady,\u201d wrote Compass agent Sara Kaye in a post about the property. \u201cNaturally this house will change hands and change form, but pouring one out for its original steward.

So far there has been no information on whether there will be a season 2 of Inside Man on Netflix, but the post-credit scene, in which Janice approaches Grieff to ask for help with her husband\u2019s murder, seems to hint at another season. With the time frame of the show taking place during about two to three days in the characters\u2019 lives, and with the final scene cutting to a week later, there is definitely a possibility to keep the showing going, since Grieff is supposed to be executed only two weeks after the end of the series.

The study, authored by Edith Cowan University professor Ken Nosaka, found that eccentric muscle contractions \u2013 the contractions that occur when a muscle is lengthened as the weight is lower \u2013 are more effective at building size. Further, the study, which was published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology , found that muscle gains could be made doing half the number of repetitions. In the study, groups of people performed three different curl exercises twice a week for five weeks as well as another group who did no exercise. One group performed eccentric-only or lowering exercises, a second group performed concentric or lifting exercises and the third group performed both concentric and eccentric exercises \u2013 but the eccentric group did half the amount of repetitions as the other groups. The study, which involved researchers from Niigata University, Nishikyushu University and Londrina University in Brazil, found that the group that performed the eccentric-only exercises achieved strength gains that equaled the other groups despite performing half the amount of repetitions, while the muscles grew more in thickness than the other groups. \u201cThis latest study shows we can be far more efficient in the time we spend exercising and still see significant results by focusing on eccentric muscle contractions,\u201d Professor Nosaka said. \u201cIn the case of a dumbbell curl, many people may believe the lifting action provides the most benefit, or at least some benefit, but we found concentric muscle contractions contributed little to the training effects,\u201d he said. Professor Nosaka suggested the relationship between our muscles and brain activation might be the key behind the findings. \u201cRecruitment of the motor unit in the brain is important for increasing our strength,\u201d he said. \u201cEccentric contractions can activate the brain more,\u201d he said, adding it takes greater concentration in focusing on lowering weights. \u201cWe already know one eccentric muscle contraction a day can increase muscle strength if it\u2019s performed five days a week \u2013 even if it\u2019s only three seconds a day \u2013 but concentric (lifting a weight) or isometric muscle contractions (holding a weight) does not provide such an effect,\u201d Professor Nosaka said.

Keaira Bennefield would be alive today if her violent, predicate-felon estranged husband had been remanded after he savagely beat her inside her apartment a few days before he shot her. But he wasn\u2019t remanded because Adam Bennefield caused only misdemeanor injuries and a judge could not set bail on him even though he had previously been convicted of a gunpoint kidnapping of two women and had served almost 15 years in state prison. Gov. Kathy Hochul either does not understand that or is afraid to anger the progressives in her party who wrote the disastrous bail reform laws that allowed this to happen. Either way, it\u2019s pathetic. Hochul tried to blame the district attorney . But the DA leveled charges that were appropriate for the defendant\u2019s actions at the time. Bennefield\u2019s injuries were only misdemeanor injuries under New York law, although the experience was terrifying. Even if the DA had been able to raise the charges to the felony of attempted assault in the second degree, the judge still could not legally set bail, and the DA could not even request it, because even this felony assault is a non-bailable offense under \u201cbail reform.\u201d Hochul tries to blame \u201cthe system,\u201d whatever that means. But in reality, she is \u201cthe system.\u201d She is the governor of New York state and the leader of the New York state Democratic Party, which single-handedly passed these laws. She was the lieutenant governor when these laws were passed and signed. She says, \u201cOrders of Protection have to be granted,\u201d apparently not realizing that one had been granted by the arraigning judge the day before the murder. She says, \u201cWe have to make sure that judges and prosecutors charge appropriately.\u201d Well, Governor, in our system, judges don\u2019t charge crimes , DAs do, and it appears that the DA did charge correctly after all. She tries to blame everyone and everything except her own inability to fix the bail laws that were signed while she was Andrew Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor. The problem, Gov. Hochul , is not \u201cthe system.\u201d The problem here is the bail laws. The problem is that unlike in every other state in America, a judge cannot consider the defendant\u2019s danger to the community or risk of reoffending when setting bail. The problem is that judges cannot set bail on a whole host of crimes no matter how many prior convictions the defendant has. The problem is that even when judges can set bail, they have to set the least restrictive bail conditions, essentially ensuring the defendant gets released. The problem is that judges cannot remand defendants who fail to comply with their conditions of release. Bail reform supporters will say that opponents of bail reform are \u201cfearmongers.\u201d It is not fearmongering to point out that crime is up 32% in New York City since bail reform \u2014 25,000 more victims so far this year than in the same period in 2019. It is \u201cfact mongering.\u201d They say that it is racist to criticize their bail reforms even though the vast majority of crime victims caused by bail reform are people of color, including 90% of murder victims and 96% of shooting victims. The sad reality is that advocates of bail reform will admit privately that their goal is to decrease the number of people in jail , and they are willing to accept the increased crime in order to achieve it. But they cannot say that publicly, so they deny that the increased crime rates are due to the release of thousands of career criminals under these bail reforms. They say they need \u201cmore data\u201d even though we now have almost three years of data that unequivocally show the failure of bail reform. They will never admit that they were wrong, as that would mean that their entire worldview was wrong. I don\u2019t doubt that the reform advocates sincerely grieve for the Bennefield family, but in reality, to them, Keaira Bennefield is just more collateral damage in their fight for \u201ccriminal justice reform.\u201d Try explaining that logic to the family of Keaira Bennefield , Gov.

Vahid Salemi/AP hide caption Demonstrators chant slogans Friday as one of them holds up a poster of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a demonstration in front of the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran on Friday marked the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran as its theocracy faces nationwide protests after the September death of a 22-year-old woman who was arrested by the country's morality police. Iranian state-run television aired live feeds of various commemorations around the country, with some in Tehran waving placards of the triangle-shaped Iranian drones Russia now uses to strike targets in its war on Ukraine. But while crowds in Tehran looked large with chador-wearing women waving the Islamic Republic's flag, other commemorations in the country appeared smaller, with only a few dozen people taking part. Iran's hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, speaking to people gathered in front of the former U.S. Embassy building, criticized those protesting the theocracy. \"Anyone taking the smallest step in the direction of breaching security and riots, must know that they are stepping in the direction of enemies of the Islamic Revolution,\" he said. \"Americans think they can execute the plan they carried out in some countries like Syria and Libya here. What a false dream!\" Those at the commemoration also waved effigies of French President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Signs and chants from the crowd called out: \"Death to America! Death to Israel!\" The demonstrations that have convulsed Iran for seven weeks after the death of Mahsa Amini mark one of the biggest challenges to the country's clerical rulers since they seized power in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. At least 300 protesters have been killed and 14,000 arrested since the unrest began, according to a Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that's been monitoring the crackdown on demonstrators. Iran's government has not offered an overall death toll, with one state newspaper even making the counterfactual claim that no one had been killed by security forces over the 49 days of protests. Later on Friday, protests began in Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchestan province, which has seen weeks of unrest. Online videos purported to show people marching in the streets and some throwing stones, with the crackle of gunfire in the background and clouds of tear gas rising. Some protesters appeared bloodied, while activists said some had been killed. No casualty figures were immediately known. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency later reported that protesters set fire to a police stand in Khash, a city in Sistan and Baluchestan, and attacked the local governor's office. On Thursday, a Shiite cleric reportedly was shot and killed in Sistan and Baluchestan, a long restive province that's predominantly Sunni. Hard-liners within Iran long have bussed government workers and others into such Nov. 4 demonstrations, which have a carnival-like feel for the students and others taking part on Taleqani Street in downtown Tehran. This year, however, it remained clear Iran's theocracy hopes to energize its hard-line base. Some signs read \"We Are Obedient To The Leader,\" referring to 83-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say over all matters of state in the country. The weekslong demonstrations have included cries calling for Khamenei's death and the overthrow of the government. The annual commemoration marks when student demonstrators climbed over the fence at the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, angered by then-President Jimmy Carter allowing the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to receive cancer treatment in the United States. The students soon took over the entire, leafy compound. A few staffers fled and hid in the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran before escaping the country with the help of the CIA, a story dramatized in the 2012 film \"Argo.\" The 444-day crisis transfixed America, as nightly images of blindfolded hostages played on television sets across the nation. Iran finally let all the captives go the day Carter left office on Ronald Reagan's inauguration day in 1981. That enmity between Iran and the U.S. has ebbed and surged over the decades since. The U.S. and world powers reached a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 that drastically curtailed its program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. However, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018, sparking years of tensions since. Late Thursday in California at a rally before the U.S. midterm elections, President Joe Biden also stopped his speech to address a crowd that held up cellphones displaying the message \"FREE IRAN.\" \"Don't worry, we're gonna free Iran,\" Biden said in an aside during a campaign rally for Democratic Rep. Mike Levin. He added, \"They're gonna free themselves pretty soon.\" In his speech Friday, Raisi referenced Biden's comments. \"Maybe he said this because of a lack of concentration. ... He said we aim to liberate Iran,\" Raisi said. \"Mr. President! Iran was liberated 43 years ago, and it's determined not to become your captive again. We will never become a milking cow.\" Biden had said he was willing to have the U.S. rejoin the nuclear deal, but talks have broken down.

Roy Blunt\u2019s seat, which is considered safely Republican. Schmitt largely campaigned against President Joe Biden and inflation, characterizing Valentine as an out-of-touch heiress who would side with the Democratic president over Missourians. Valentine\u2019s campaign catchphrase was \"nobody\u2019s senator but yours,\" and she slammed Schmitt for voting as a state senator to allow foreign ownership of farmland and over his support for the state\u2019s ban on abortion .

Decision Notes AP will tabulate and declare winners in 101 contested elections in Missouri, including seven statewide races and eight U.S. House races. In the 2020 general election, AP first reported results at 8:19 p.m. ET and 99.5% of results by 3 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Nov. 5. AP does not make projections or name apparent or likely winners. Only when AP is fully confident a race has been won \u2013 defined most simply as the moment a trailing candidate no longer has a path to victory \u2013 will we make a call. Should a candidate declare victory \u2013 or offer a concession \u2013 before AP calls a race, we will cover newsworthy developments in our reporting. In doing so, we will make clear that AP has not yet declared a winner and explain the reason why we believe the race is too early or too close to call. The AP may call a statewide or U.S. House race in which the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5% or less, if we determine the lead is too large for a recount to change the outcome. Missouri does not have a mandatory recount law. For offices filed with Secretary of State (president, federal, judicial, state legislature) a recount can be requested if the candidate was defeated by less than 0.5% of votes cast for office. For offices filed with local election authorities, a recount can be requested if a candidate was defeated by less than 1% of votes cast. The AP will not call down-ballot races on election night if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 2%. AP will revisit those races later in the week to confirm there aren\u2019t enough outstanding votes left to count that could change the outcome.

A: Missourians were unwilling to support former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, tarnished by scandal, who finished third in the GOP Senate race. Q: What\u2019s Changed Since the Pandemic Election of 2020? A: Voter ID will be required in November, which could increase the number of provisional ballots cast. And a recent change in state law allows no-excuse in-person voting from the second Tuesday before Election Day until the day before Election Day. This may shift voting turnout for the general election. Q: What Do Turnout and Advance Vote Look Like? A: Voter turnout is projected to be about 2.6 million. Q: How Long Does Counting Usually Take? A: Absentee ballots are due by or before Election Day and may begin being processed five days before the election, which speeds things up. Nearly all absentee totals are reported in the first wave of results, which usually appears about 30 minutes after polls close. Historically, only 0.5% of ballots remain uncounted on Election Day.

It was a flyer publicizing open tryouts for the Georgia Military School football team. At the time, Young was working long hours as an assistant manager at Dollar General in Columbus, Georgia. He'd also done some moonlighting at Burger King and later worked some night shifts at a Circle K convenience store. \"I wasn't on anybody's radar, at least not on anybody's football radar. But I stayed in shape and never gave up on my dream of playing college football,\" said Young, a 24-year-old senior outside linebacker and the Vols' top pass-rusher. \"It wasn't an easy path, but a lot of guys on this team didn't have easy paths. That's a big part of what's made us who we are.\" So just who are these Vols, other than a team that has risen from the football ashes over the past decade and a half to grab the No. 1 spot in the first College Football Playoff rankings heading into Saturday's showdown with No. 3 Georgia at Sanford Stadium? Put simply, it's a team with a lot more five-star stories than five-star recruits. \"A lot of guys on this team were told what they weren't or what they couldn't do,\" said junior receiver Jalin Hyatt, who leads the nation with 14 touchdown catches. \"That has a way of bringing a team together because you know what the guy beside you had to do just to get here.\" Up and down Tennessee's roster, there are castoffs, transfers who were given up on by their previous schools, breakout players who have seemingly come out of nowhere, players who have battled through adversity or were spurned during the high school recruiting process and coaches who were fired. \"I think everything that everybody's gone through before they got here or while they were here is a part of the fabric of who they are,\" said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel, himself a castoff from Oklahoma, his alma mater. \"I think it reveals the character and the competitiveness of those individuals too. I don't know if there's a chip on their shoulder necessarily, but it's a part of the reason why we continue to get better.\" No player personifies the identity of this Tennessee team more than quarterback Hendon Hooker, the odds-on Heisman Trophy favorite. It was made clear to Hooker following the 2020 season that his days as a quarterback at Virginia Tech were over and he needed to find a new place to play. He found that place in Tennessee. Hyatt is on the kind of tear receivers dream about with 11 touchdown receptions in his past four games, after catching a total of four TDs in his first two seasons on campus. As a high school recruit, Hyatt was told he was too skinny and too frail to play at either of the Power 5 schools (Clemson and South Carolina) in his home state of South Carolina. That was despite catching 57 touchdown passes during his high school career at powerhouse Dutch Fork, which is located about 20 miles from South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium. Kicker Chase McGrath started his career as a walk-on at USC before tearing a ligament in his knee as a sophomore, sitting out the entire COVID-19 season in 2020, then transferring to Tennessee. His knuckleball 40-yard field goal was the game-winner against Alabama, snapping the Vols' 15-game losing streak in the series and setting off a wild celebration at Neyland Stadium. Cedric Tillman, the Vols' All-SEC receiver from a year ago, came to Tennessee from Las Vegas as a two-star recruit. His other offers were from Hawai'i, UNLV and Weber State. Tillman has missed most of this season after undergoing ankle surgery. He returned last week against Kentucky, but the Vols limited his snaps. Heupel said Tillman is \"ready to roll\" against Georgia. There are similar stories on the coaching staff. Rodney Garner, one of the top defensive line coaches and recruiters in the country, was a part of Gus Malzahn's Auburn staff that was fired following the 2020 season. Even Heupel was unceremoniously dumped in 2014 as quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator at Oklahoma, the school he helped lead to a national championship in 2000 as its QB and the Heisman Trophy runner-up. Heupel originally landed in Oklahoma by way of Weber State and Snow College, a junior college in Ephraim, Utah, and only after then-OU offensive coordinator Mike Leach convinced the rest of the Sooners' staff that Heupel was worth a scholarship. \"We all have some cool stories, and you know, we're not done writing them,\" Hooker said. \"We all have the same goal.\" That goal -- the first step, getting to Atlanta and winning an SEC championship -- was unimaginable less than two years ago when Heupel took over a program that was in shambles with 30-plus players transferring out and an NCAA investigation looming. The university had launched its own internal probe into recruiting improprieties that led to the firing of former coach Jeremy Pruitt for cause. But now that goal appears within the Vols' reach, and they can take a major step toward it Saturday if they can snap a five-game losing streak to Georgia in only the third AP No. 1 vs. No. 2 regular-season matchup in SEC history. Tennessee last won the national championship in 1998, and Garner, who was on the staff in 1996 and 1997, helped recruit several of the core players of that team, including Tee Martin, Jamal Lewis, Cosey Coleman and Deon Grant. When Garner (who played at Auburn under Pat Dye) had a chance to come back to Tennessee under Heupel, it was a no-brainer for Garner, his wife Kim and their six daughters. \"Back then, you could walk anywhere with that 'T' on your chest, and it commanded respect,\" Garner said of his earlier stint at the school. \"Even though I didn't play here, this has always been a special place to me, and to play even a small part in its resurgence means a lot. I'm proud of the way these guys have played for each other, just like those teams in the '90s. It was always more about Tennessee than it was about the individuals. That's the thing we had to get back to when Coach Heupel and all of us got here. \"Everybody needed to understand how blessed they were to be at Tennessee versus that Tennessee was blessed to have you. It's been awesome to see these guys come together and play for something bigger than themselves.\" It never hurts when you're chasing a championship to have your best players on offense (Hooker) and defense (Young) also be two of your best leaders. They're both 24 and have seen a little bit of everything. Hooker started 15 games at Virginia Tech over three seasons, but never got the feeling that he was truly then-coach Justin Fuente's guy. After a game against Clemson in 2020, Hooker began shivering and shaking on the sideline after losing a fumbled snap in the third quarter. Hooker walked back to the locker room with a trainer. Fuente told reporters afterward that Hooker was \"cold.\" Hooker said he had a reaction to some medication he was taking for a heart condition he had in 2019. Either way, he never played another snap at quarterback for Virginia Tech. \"I don't want to make assumptions, but I had a feeling something was going on at the beginning of that season. Hendon won the job, but they said the other kid [Braxton Burmeister] deserved to play,\" said Hooker's father, Alan Hooker, who was a North Carolina A&T Hall of Fame quarterback. \"Somehow, some way, they just decided Hendon wasn't their guy. They didn't have complete trust in him, and he wasn't going to be invited back. It was pretty much that simple.\" Hooker's steady demeanor is unchanged whether he's trying to elude a 250-pound defensive end, talking to a reporter or rallying his teammates. But his eyes narrow at any mention that Virginia Tech gave up on him following that Clemson game because the coaches there made it seem like he was soft. \"I'm sure you can ask my opponents, and they'd tell you I'm not soft at all,\" Hooker said. \"And I don't get the whole 'cold' thing either. In 2019, we played in pouring-down rain against Pittsburgh, and I threw three touchdowns with short sleeves on. I didn't hear anything then about being cold or soft.\" Once he arrived at Tennessee, Hooker had to prove himself all over again. There was also a twist. Less than three weeks after he got on campus, Pruitt was fired as Tennessee's coach, meaning Hooker had a whole new offensive system to learn, a system that couldn't have been a better fit. But even then, Hooker still hadn't won the starting job after his first spring practice under Heupel. The Vols brought in Michigan transfer Joe Milton right after the spring, and Milton was named the starter for the first two games of the 2021 season. But since moving in as the starter in Week 3 in 2021, Hooker has accounted for 59 touchdowns, completed 69.2% of his passes and thrown just three interceptions. \"We had seen him on tape and knew he was dynamic potentially with his feet,\" Heupel said. \"Now, did we envision that first spring that he was going to be playing like this? I can't say that. But the guy has made such strides. It's crazy, just fundamentally, the mental part of the game and being completely confident and comfortable in himself and being relaxed out there. \"He understands that he doesn't have to play perfect, and you put all that together, and he's playing at such an elite level. It's really fun to watch.\" As great as he's been on the field, Hooker's priority is to be a good teammate. He was the first one to volunteer to pick up his right guard, Javontez Spraggins, every morning at 5:30 after Spraggins' car died. For the Kentucky game last week, Hooker had several of his old teammates from Virginia Tech come to town after the Hokies had played Thursday night. \"They were all at Hendon's apartment, sleeping on couches and the floor,\" Alan Hooker said. Young has been the defensive equivalent of Hooker for the Vols. He's played his way into being a potential early-round NFL draft pick in his second season and leads the team with 13 quarterback pressures. More importantly, he's one of the most respected voices in the locker room, and his story resonates with the entire team. After graduating from tiny Carvers Bay High School in Hemingway, South Carolina, in 2017, Young was small for an edge rusher (213 pounds) and didn't have the grades to get into a four-year college. He wound up at Gulf Coast Prep Sports Academy in Mt. Vernon, Alabama, played two games during the 2017 season, only to have the school abruptly fold. \"The whole thing was a sham, and Byron came back home,\" said Ike Young, Byron's oldest brother. \"But he wasn't about to give up. That's not how he was raised.\" Young moved to Columbus, Georgia, where Ike and some of his brothers lived. There were 13 children in the family, and Ike is retired from the military. He has a son who is a year older than Byron. \"Byron wasn't afraid of manual labor. None of us were,\" Ike Young said. \"We had a wood-burning stove and went out and chopped up wood and dragged it back home.\" That same work ethic kept Young going for nearly a year and a half, whether he was stocking shelves at Dollar General or opening and closing the store. \"I still think about those days and what it taught me,\" Young said. \"In fact, sometimes when we're about to run back on the field, [teammate] Roman Harrison will look at me and say, 'Remember Dollar General. Remember where you came from.'\" Young tried out for and made the Georgia Military School team and blossomed in 2019 as one of the more highly recruited junior college prospects in the country. He got bigger and stronger and was a terror chasing down quarterbacks. The 2020 season was canceled because of COVID-19, but his 2019 tape was good enough that several SEC schools pursued him. One of those schools was Auburn, and Garner was the point man in recruiting Young. At the time, Young was close to picking the Tigers, but as fate would have it, he and Garner ended up together at Tennessee. \"I'm just glad it worked out the way it did because I really wanted him when I was at Auburn before we got fired there,\" Garner said. \"That's the way it goes sometimes. I almost came back here to Tennessee when Lane [Kiffin] got the job. I came up here and interviewed and everything. I actually took the job before I came. But I got up here and things just didn't feel right.\" Sure enough, Kiffin left Tennessee less than a year later for USC. Young looks back on his journey and has that same \"it was meant to be\" feeling. He jokes that he has a \"senior citizen\" on the team in Hooker, who he can relate to amid all the younger players in the program. \"I went the long route to get here and so did Hendon. We weren't the only ones,\" Young said. \"A lot of guys had to find new places to play. We've found that place, and we're not close to being done.\" Hyatt thought he had found his place at Virginia Tech when he committed to the Hokies in February 2019. Both Clemson and South Carolina passed on him, primarily because he was 153 pounds coming out of high school and they thought he wasn't sturdy enough to play at a high level. \"I went to camps at Clemson and South Carolina just to showcase my skills,\" Hyatt said. \"They just kept saying, 'We'll see. We'll see.' But nothing ever came of it.\" It won't be lost on Hyatt that two of the people who didn't think he could cut it at South Carolina will be on the Georgia sideline Saturday. Will Muschamp, the Dawgs' defensive coordinator, was South Carolina's head coach during Hyatt's recruitment, while Bryan McClendon, Georgia's receivers coach, was the Gamecocks' offensive coordinator and receivers coach. \"It sucked not getting an offer from your hometown school because I feel like they should be the first ones to offer,\" Hyatt said. \"But they never did, and I know why. Things work out the way they're supposed to, and I'm glad they thought I was too small. It helped lead me here, and look at what all I would have missed.\" Hyatt had offers from other FBS schools and always believed his speed would set him apart despite how thin he was. His father, Jamie, felt the same way. Jamie remembers a conversation they had with Muschamp the summer before Jalin's junior year in high school. Jamie said Jalin ran a scorching 40-yard dash and that Muschamp even called Jalin's high school coach at Dutch Fork, Tom Knotts, to tell him it was one of the fastest 40 times he'd ever seen. When they met afterward, Jamie said Muschamp looked at Jalin and said, \"Man, you're fast, but you need to eat more peanut butter.\" At that point, nothing else needed to be said. \"I still talk to Coach Muschamp and we chop it up. [Georgia] is recruiting my younger son,\" said Jamie, whose son Devin is attending IMG Academy. \"But I can tell you -- and I don't think Coach Muschamp meant it personally -- that our business was done with South Carolina after that. We needed to move on, and I know Jalin has used it for motivation.\" Hyatt's commitment to Virginia Tech didn't last. Former Tennessee national championship-winning quarterback Martin was one of the coaches on Pruitt's staff who closed the deal on getting Hyatt to flip to the Vols. \"I'd always wanted to play in the SEC too, because you want to play against the best,\" Hyatt said. One of the first people Hooker texted when he got to campus was Hyatt. They met when Hyatt was on a recruiting visit to Virginia Tech. \"Where do we meet? Let's go throw,\" Hooker's text read. And as Hyatt would get to the football complex every day, the first car he would see was Hooker's. \"His car was the last one there too,\" Hyatt said. \"I thought, 'Does he ever leave?'\" Hooker's focus, demeanor and work ethic all wore off on Hyatt, not to mention just about everybody else on the team. Hyatt admitted he needed to mature his first couple of years on campus. But now, there's not a more dynamic combination in college football than Hooker and Hyatt; the pair has been at the core of an offense that leads the country in scoring (49.4 points per game). \"It's all of our confidence, really, that's grown, and that goes straight to Coach Heup,\" Hyatt said. \"As an offense, I feel like when we step on the field there's nobody that can stop us. The only people who can stop us are ourselves.\" One of the favorite traditions of the Hooker family is watching Christmas specials every year. A staple is \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" Alan Hooker looks at this Tennessee team, a team that has surpassed even the wildest expectations, and can't help but think about Rudolph's visit to the Land of the Misfit Toys. \"That's kind of what you have with Tennessee,\" Alan Hooker said. \"All these guys have different stories, some of them stories of rejection.

Irving later issued an apology over Instagram on Thursday night. \"I ain't here to judge nobody or talk down on nobody for how they feel, their view or anything,\" Durant said following the Friday shootaround. \"I just didn't like anything that went on. I feel like it was all unnecessary. I felt like we could have just kept playing basketball and kept quiet as an organization. I just don't like none of it.\" Durant tweeted to clarify his comments, saying, \"I don't condone hate speech or antisemitism.\" General manager Sean Marks, who traveled with the team for the Friday game against the Washington Wizards, said the Nets never considered waiving Irving in the wake of this latest controversy. \"No,\" Marks said. \"Not at this point in time.\" Marks said that while the apology on Instagram was a good first step, Irving will need to take more steps, including \"counseling designated by the team\" as well as meeting with Jewish leaders within the Brooklyn community, before being able to play for the Nets again. \"I think after anything like this, you would always hope that there's a change,\" Marks said. \"There's a change in feelings, a change in attitude, I think, per his apology, that's a step in the right direction. But as we've sort of stated, actions speak louder than words. And so he's had some time and there will be more time to reflect on that. \"... He's going to have to sit down [with Jewish leaders]. He's going to have to sit down with the organization after this. And we'll evaluate and see if this is the right opportunity to bring him back.\" When asked if he agreed with the team's decision to suspend Irving, Durant said, \"I believe and trust in the organization to do what's right.\" As a longtime superstar in the league, Durant understands and has discussed the around-the-clock coverage that the NBA and its players receive. \"It's just the way of the NBA now,\" Durant said. \"Media, there's so many outlets now and stories hit pretty fast now. That's where all the chaos is coming from. Everybody's opinion, and everybody has an opinion on this situation, and we're hearing it nonstop. \"But once the balls start bouncing and we get into practice, none of that stuff seeps into the gym, so that's the cool part about being in the gym.

But I will point out that Dixon never said your name.

As it turns out, that adds up to a movie where Weird Al becomes an abusive, alcoholic mess enabled by his conniving, self-centered girlfriend, who also happens to be the queen of pop herself, Madonna. In case you still weren\u2019t sure how serious this all is, the movie is based on the 2013 Funny or Die trailer for a fake Weird Al biopic, which was written and directed by comedian Eric Appel. (Appel also directed Weird , and co-wrote the script with Yankovic.) It also comes with a brand new original Weird Al song, \u201cNow You Know,\u201d which plays over the credits and gleefully declares, \u201cIf it happens in a movie, it must be true,\u201d and, \u201cWe only changed one thing\u2014I really did play Live Aid with Queen!\u201d Hopefully, you recognize Weird: The Al Yankovic Story for the hilariously absurd and absolutely untrue joke that is. That said, there are nuggets of truth in the movie, and Yankovic himself recently spoke to Decider to help clear up some of the confusion as to how accurate the Weird Al movie is. Read on to learn more about the Weird: The Al Yankovic Story true story. Warning: This article contains mild Weird: The Al Yankovic Story spoilers. Save this to read until after you\u2019ve seen the movie. Kind of\u2026 but not really. Weird: The Al Yankovic Story is a parody of \u201cbased on true story biopics,\u201d much like the songs that made the musician famous in the first place. While some of the details are true to Yankovic\u2019s real career as a parody songwriter, many more are changed or fabricated to poke fun at the biopic format. It\u2019s not accurate at all. Hopefully, if you\u2019ve seen the movie, you started to cotton on to the fact that Weird is not an accurate Weird Al movie pretty quickly. That said, for Yankovic\u2014who co-wrote the script with director Eric Appel\u2014confusing people is all part of the fun. \u201cObviously, I have to promote the movie, and we all have to talk about it,\u201d Yankovic told Decider in a recent interview . \u201cBut part of me wishes that people could go into this movie not knowing anything about it and will believe, at least at the beginning, that it\u2019s a really serious biopic. Because it starts out fairly normally. And then it gets progressively more and more off the rails. I hope that, at some point in the movie, people go, \u2018Wait a minute\u2026 did this really happen?'\u201d While some details\u2014particularly those involving Madonna (played by Evan Rachel Wood) and a certain infamous drug lord\u2014are obviously over-the-top and invented, even some small details were changed, just for the hell of it. This was\u2014 Yankovic told The New York Times in a separate interview\u2014in part because the comedian wanted to make fun of how fast-and-loose real biopics tend to be with the facts. He was particularly annoyed by a detail in the recent Elton John biopic, Rocketman, in which the rockstar is shown changing his name after seeing a photo of John Lennon. \u201cEverybody who\u2019s an Elton John fan knows it was inspired by Long John Baldry. I guess they thought nobody knows who Long John Baldry is,\u201d Yankovic told the Times . He went on to say this inspired him to tweak tiny details of his own story\u2014like recording his first hit, \u201cMy Bologna,\u201d in a bus station bathroom. \u201cI did record it in a bathroom but not in a bus station. Why did we change it? Just \u2019cause that\u2019s what biopics do.\u201d (He added that song was also not born out of an inspirational, out-of-body experience, as depicted in the movie.) Yes! While much of Weird was made up, there are some bits that are true. Perhaps the most notable example is the moment in the movie when a young Al receives his first accordion via a traveling, door-to-door salesman. While Yankovic\u2019s father did not violently beat up that salesman, as happens in the movie, that really is how Yankovic acquired his first accordion when he was just 7 years old. \u201cThis would have been 1966, maybe,\u201d Yankovic told Decider in his interview . \u201cThat gentleman was welcomed into our home, and my parents were offered either guitar lessons or accordion lessons for a young child. My parents made the life-altering decision that I should take accordion lessons. Because they figured when you played the accordion, you\u2019re a one-man band, you\u2019re the life of any party. Who wouldn\u2019t want an accordion player hanging around? They thought if I learned the accordion, I would never be lonely!\u201d Yankovic went on to say that, jokes aside, the accordion was a good decision on his parents\u2019 part, because the instrument made him stand out to Dr. Demento, the radio broadcaster who hosted a show of novelty and comedy music. As you see in the movie, the real Al really did spend much of his childhood secretly listening to Dr. Demento while hiding under a blanket. In 1976, a teenage Yankovic submitted a song to the show\u2014 \u201cBelvedere Cruising,\u201d a song about the Yankovic family\u2019s rundown car\u2014and Dr. Demento played it on the air. \u201cDr. Demento told me after the fact that if I had sent him a tape in the mail of me playing guitar, he probably wouldn\u2019t have given it a second listen because there\u2019s nothing unusual or novel about that,\u201d Yankovic told Decider. \u201cBut a kid playing the accordion and thinking he was cool\u2014he said that made his ears perk up and that that gave him the impetus to give me some airplay.\u201d Dr. Demento, whose real name is Barry Hansen, was not exactly the father/manager figure that Rainn Wilson portrayed him to be in the movie. The real Hansen told the crowd at the New York premiere of Weird that he did not host epic, celebrity-laden pool parties, and he did not give Weird Al his iconic name. (That came from a mean-spirited college nickname, according to a 2020 New York Times Magazine profile.) But he was, Yankovic said, an extremely vital person in launching the Weird Al career. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, there was nobody in the world that would have given me airplay other than Dr. Demento,\u201d Yankovic told Decider. \u201cAnd he gave me support and encouragement very early on that I can\u2019t imagine I would have received from anybody else in that position.\u201d No. Weird Al and Madonna were never in a romantic relationship. Weird Al, by his own admission, doesn\u2019t even really know Madonna. In a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show , Yankovic said he met Madonna exactly one time, in 1985. \u201cI talked to her for maybe like 45 seconds backstage. So that\u2019s the extent of the relationship.\u201d Yankovic told Decider that no one from his team warned Madonna ahead of the film\u2019s release, but he hopes she takes it in stride. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Madonna\u2019s seen it yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of doubt that she has. We didn\u2019t get her blessing ahead of time, so we\u2019re hoping that she\u2019s cool with it and that she understands it\u2019s a joke.\u201d He added that came at the advice of the movie\u2019s lawyers. \u201cOur lawyers told us it would be best not to red-flag it with anybody because they\u2019ve said they\u2019re public figures, so it\u2019s fair game. I took their word for it!\u201d That said, it is true that Madonna was the one who came up with the idea for Weird Al to parody her song, \u201cLike A Virgin.\u201d According to the 2020 New York Times Magazin e profile of Yankovic, \u201cMadonna wondered aloud to a friend when Weird Al would turn \u2018Like a Virgin\u2019 into \u2018Like a Surgeon,\u2019 and word got back to Weird Al, and he did.\u201d But it\u2019s safe to say it was never a romance. Yankovic has been married to his wife, Suzanne Yankovic\u2014whom he met when she was a marketing executive at 20th Century Fox\u2014since 2001. The two have a 19-year-old daughter, Nina.

Regulations issued during the first two years of the Biden administration cost the economy an estimated $309 billion, which is 50% more expensive than the first two years of the Obama administration and nearly eight times as expensive as rules released in all four years of the Trump administration. Biden's regulatory cost reflects the 443 final rules issued through late October 2022, which required roughly 193,000,000 hours of compliance paperwork across the nation, according to federal data collected by the American Action Forum.

His \u2018coalition of the ascendant\u2019 wasn't. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (AP) This shift in Hispanic political support shouldn't come as a big surprise. Hispanics have been among the biggest losers of the Biden economy. They are disproportionately impacted by ongoing historic inflation and record gas prices that are a direct consequence of Democrats' reckless spending and energy prohibitions. While Democrats try to gaslight Hispanics that these regressive taxes are no big deal, many Hispanics whose office is their pickup truck or who make an hourly wage that ends in \"teen\" are seeing their living standards significantly decline. Americans have lost approximately $6,000 annually due to inflation, a blow that's much more painful for those with lower incomes. Hispanics' economic pain is especially pronounced considering their remarkable financial success during the pre-pandemic Trump administration. Thanks to sound policies such as tax cuts and deregulation, Hispanics' real median income rose by 7.1% in 2019 versus 5.7% for whites. Their wages grew 24% faster than during President Barack Obama's second term. \"Give us the shared economic prosperity of 2018 and 2019 back,\" many Latino voters are saying. Instead of addressing these significant economic headwinds, Democrats have pursued a radical cultural agenda, which has led to increased crime and terrible schools, that disproportionately impacts Hispanics. Extended and unjustifiable classroom closures in many states through most of 2020 and 2021 have devastated minority children's education.

Mimi Parker, known for her chilling vocals and sparse drumming in the critically acclaimed rock band Low , died on Saturday. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2020. \"Friends, it's hard to put the universe into language and into a short message,\" the band's official Twitter account posted on Sunday morning. \"She passed away last night, surrounded by family and love, including yours. Keep her name close and sacred. Share this moment with someone who needs you. Love is indeed the most important thing.\" Formed in 1993 by Parker and her husband Alan Sparhawk in Duluth, Minn., Low emerged as a crucial group in what would come to be defined as the decade's slowcore movement. Known for its beautifully simple, droning and dark instrumentals, the band was anchored by the delicate vocal harmonies of its central couple, which could cut through even the harshest noise. \"I've been pushing towards the beauty and I know Alan sometimes focuses on the chaos,\" Parker said of the band's music in a 2021 interview with All Things Considered . Born and raised in Minnesota, in an interview with the magazine Chickfactor Parker said she grew up in a musical family, to a mother who was an aspiring country singer. \"My role was always to come up with harmonies, because she and my sister would usually sing the lead,\" she told Terry Gross in a 2005 interview with Fresh Air of making music early with her family. \"From the beginning I learned how to just listen and draw and come up with harmonies.\" Parker first played drums in her high school marching band. Both practicing Mormons, she and Sparhawk first met in fourth grade and began dating when they were in junior high school. Years later the two would marry, and eventually form Low with original bass player John Nichols. \"Honestly, if it hadn't been for the marriage, for the family ... we never would have survived this long as a band,\" Parker, who shares two children with Sparhawk, told NPR in 2021. The band's debut I Could Live in Hope was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and Low would go on to release 13 albums in 27 years. The band signed with the influential label Sub Pop in 2004, and its dynamic sound continued to expand with releases such as 2018's Double Negative , described in NPR Music's Best Albums of 2018 list as \"a collection of crackling transmissions sent across the din, hopeful voices rising out of the craggy darkness.\" The band's last album with Parker was 2021's celebrated HEY WHAT. In August the band canceled a series of shows in Europe to accommodate Parker's cancer treatments, later announcing in October that it was canceling a European tour entirely. \"There have been difficult days, but your love has sustained us and will continue to lift us through this time,\" Sparhawk wrote in a statement at the time. In a 2022 episode of the Sheroes Radio podcast , Parker revealed that she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in December 2020. \"I think it's important to \u2014 when people get a diagnosis \u2014 some people have a tendency to ask why, why me,\" Parker said. \"I never had that.

The gunman, a bodyguard known as \u201cLittle Beijing,\u201d leapt onto a table at the center of the room and took aim at a man singing into a microphone. He unloaded his pistol, striking his target \u2013 a businessman and investor in an interstate Chinatown bus line \u2013 six times from a distance of about two feet, close enough the gunpowder exploding off the gun seared the victim\u2019s skin. A hostess who ducked for cover when the shots rang out was hit in the head as she cowered, the bullet ripping through her brain. Both of the victims were killed nearly instantly. The man who allegedly ordered the gunman to open fire that night in 2004 was a 32-year-old Chinatown Dai Lo, or gang leader, named Xing Lin, aka Ding Pa, apparently motivated by greed and a desire for clout. At his RICO trial years later, Ding Pa\u2019s defense attorneys claimed a rival gangster and prolific government informant had helped federal prosecutors in Manhattan orchestrate the case by providing a parade of witnesses to testify about their client\u2019s guilt. The informant was Qian Zheng, a well-known figure in gambling parlors and other seedy neighborhood hangouts. In Chinatown, he was known as Cash. For nearly two decades \u2013 from 1998 through 2015 \u2013 Cash was a snitch for NYPD Major Case Squad detectives and federal immigration investigators, according to court documents recently unsealed at the request of The Post. For at least eight of those years, he was also the head of a violent organized crime outfit \u2013 later dubbed the \u201cZheng Organization\u201d by the feds \u2013 that trafficked ketamine and MDMA, ran a high-stakes gambling parlor, collected debts through violence and extorted business owners in New York\u2019s Asian-American communities, according to court documents. For the host of crimes he committed as a Dai Lo, Cash pleaded guilty to racketeering in Brooklyn federal court in 2017 and was sentenced to nine years in prison. The details of how he began working as a source for the NYPD are murky, in part because the first decade of his informant file is missing, according to a newly unsealed sentencing submission filed by his attorney in 2017. In the memo, Cash\u2019s attorney claimed \u201cdozens of convictions, from both state and federal prosecutions involving prostitution, smuggling, human trafficking, assault, gang activity, murder, and police corruption were secured with his assistance.\u201d Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Back in 2007, Cash became the owner and manager of a bus company that ferried passengers to the south from New York. Around the same time, he passed information to law enforcement about extortion and collusion in the industry, as well as violence and cigarette smuggling along the routes, according to the documents. In 2009, he told the NYPD about off-duty cops who worked as security guards at an \u201cunderground club,\u201d illegally selling parking permits and allegedly swiping cash from a separate nightspot when police raided it. Then in 2014, he passed along another tip about NYPD officers from the 109 precinct in Flushing extorting one of his \u201cbusiness partner[s].\u201d The business partner later made recordings of the officers, which led to the arrest of three cops, according to the documents. Cash also spent years as a stoolie for Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of ICE, the documents state. In his first stint as a federal informant from 2003 to 2006, he sang about a human trafficking victim, wore a wire on a \u201chandful of occasions\u201d and provided information about murder, extortion, alien smuggling and money laundering,\u201d then-HSI Acting Deputy Assistant Director Anthony Scandiffio said in a letter submitted in his case. \u201c[Cash] also set up a dinner party for the targets of the investigation, which aided in the arrest of these individuals,\u201d Scandiffio added in the 2017 letter. His second stint as an ICE informant started in 2010 \u2014 not long before feds hunting Ding Pa over the 2004 Flushing shooting tracked him down to Toronto, Canada, and arrested him. Prosecutors alleged that Ding Pa had been extorting a bus line run by the singer gunned down in the Kissena Boulevard karaoke joint. When the victim refused to pay, Ding Pa worried he was losing \u201cface\u201d \u2013 or respect \u2013 as a shot-caller in the neighborhood \u2013 and went to the karaoke joint that night to flex his muscle, prosecutors said. After his bust, Ding Pa struck a plea deal with Manhattan federal prosecutors that would have required him to plead guilty to aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in an extortion conspiracy and serve 10 years in prison. But at a 2012 plea hearing, Judge Miriam Cedarbaum rejected his spoken acceptance of guilt \u2013 known as an allocution \u2013 because Ding Pa couldn\u2019t say he ordered the alleged gunman, Little Beijing, to kill his rival that night. He was convicted at trial in 2013 of racketeering and other crimes and sentenced to life in prison. During his time as an ICE source between 2010 and 2014, Cash \u201cprovided the names and contact information of witnesses to a murder, which contributed to the suspect\u2019s arrest,\u201d Scandiffio wrote, apparently referring to Ding Pa. Cash\u2019s dual roles as Dai Lo and informant smack of someone who played the criminal justice system to earn money on the street, federal prosecutors argued in a newly unsealed 2017 sentencing submission. \u201cIt is clear from the defendant\u2019s behavior that he acted as an informant to further his own agenda,\u201d Assistant US Attorneys Nadia E. Moore and Maria Cruz Melendez wrote. \u201cThe defendant operated commercial bus companies and extorted rival bus companies. The defendant distributed narcotics and provided information about other narcotics distributors,\u201d the memo states. \u201cThe defendant operated illegal gambling businesses and provided information about others who ran illegal gambling parlors.\u201d It goes on: \u201cThe defendant extorted business owners, and provided information about others who also engaged in extortion. The defendant committed and solicited numerous acts of extreme violence, and provided information about violent crimes. The defendant was involved in alien smuggling and provided information about alien smuggling.\u201d In many cases, Cash provided information to the cops he had learned from other people \u2013but refused to introduce the actual source of the information to the cops, the memo states. He did so, \u201cin order to maintain their relationship and potentially obtain a benefit from the NYPD,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. In surreptitious recordings, Cash told his underlings he would have his rivals deported or arrested if they crossed him, the documents state. ICE also \u201cassisted\u201d in Cash obtaining a work permit in the US, according to the documents. In May 2013, Cash told an underling to beat a bus passenger, according to the documents. When the NYPD responded to a 911 call about the assault, he allegedly showed the cops his handler\u2019s card to avoid arrest. After his arrest in the RICO case, Cash told his wife from jail that he was waiting for \u201cthe big one\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Scandiffio \u2014 to help him get visitation privileges and use of a phone behind bars, the documents state. \u201cHe cherry picked whatever he reported to his handler,\u201d a criminal defense attorney who works with Asian New Yorkers told The Post. \u201cYou can pretend like you\u2019re helping the police while you\u2019re making ill-gotten gains on the other side.\u201d When he was arrested in 2015, Cash hadn\u2019t held an above-board job in three years, but was driving a $95,000 Mercedes-Benz and wearing a Rolex and a jade necklace. He was also carrying a New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association card, according to the prosecutors\u2019 sentencing memo. \u201cThe defendant likely intended to use this car[d] in the case of an encounter with law enforcement to attempt to avoid arrest and prosecution,\u201d the document states. Cash was released from prison under the First Step Act in September after serving nearly seven years, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons said. The NYPD, HSI and the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York did not comment. Cash\u2019s current attorney also declined to comment. Ding Pa, now 50, was resentenced earlier this year to 27 years in prison after the Supreme Court ruled a robbery count he was convicted of did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He\u2019s due to be released in 2034 and expects to immediately be deported to China upon release. Since his arrest in 2011, Ding Pa has not admitted in court that he ordered Little Beijing \u2014 who has not been caught \u2014 to kill the man in the karaoke bar that night in 2004. At his first sentencing, he lamented that he was unable to agree to the 10-year plea deal \u2013 and blamed false testimony of witnesses at his trial for his conviction. \u201cI tried to plead guilty but I could not tell you that I order Little Beijing to shoot or kill [the vicitm], because it wasn\u2019t my intention. Still, I shouldn\u2019t have been there with a bodyguard carrying a gun,\u201d Ding Pa said. In a recent interview, Ding Pa\u2019s trial attorney, Joel Cohen, told The Post he still does not believe his former client told Little Beijing to open fire that night. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t sound like him. If he was going to f\u2013k somebody up, he would\u2019ve done it himself. He wouldn\u2019t have asked an underling to do it,\u201d Cohen said. Cohen added he thought Cash orchestrated the prosecution against him in an attempt to further ingratiate himself with law enforcement. \u201cHe was providing so much good information to ICE that they were willing to overlook anything he did short of murdering somebody,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt also gave him a lot of face in the community. Everyone knew Cash was an informant. He didn\u2019t hide it; he exploited it,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cEveryone knew Cash was untouchable.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [6.99087381362915, 10.69404411315918]}, {"title": "Astros fan Mattress Mack makes history with winning $75 million World Series bet", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/mattress-mack-wins-75-million-bet-with-astros-world-series-victory/", "description": "Mattress Mack is laughing all the way to the bank.", "content": "Mattress Mack is laughing all the way to the bank.

Go into almost any park and there's often reminders to refrain from going near, petting or feeding wildlife. Not licking strange animals was simply a given \u2014 until now. The National Park Service has added tongue-contact with the Sonoran desert toad among its various warnings for park visitors. \"As we say with most things you come across in a national park, whether it be a banana slug, unfamiliar mushroom, or a large toad with glowing eyes in the dead of night, please refrain from licking,\" the agency wrote on Facebook this past week. The toad, also known as the Colorado river toad, is about seven inches in size and carries a weak, low-pitched ribbit sound. But the creature is far from harmless. Sonoran desert toads secrete a potent toxin that can make people sick if they touch it or get the poison in their mouth, according to the National Park Service. Despite the risks, some people have discovered that the toad's toxic secretions contain a powerful hallucinogenic known as 5-MeO-DMT. In recent years, smoking the amphibian's secretions has grown in popularity \u2014 so much so that the species is even considered threatened at least in New Mexico due to \"collectors that want to use the animal for drug use,\" according to the state's Department of Game & Fish. A number of public figures have reported experimenting with the toad's extracted toxins.

It was the runaway leader. It received 54 of a possible 63 first-place votes in the Associated Press poll. It had the two best players in the country, reigning Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young and defensive dynamo Will Anderson Jr., added impact transfers like Jahmyr Gibbs of Georgia Tech and Eli Ricks of LSU, and had Nick Saban, the best coach in the sport\u2019s history, patrolling the sideline. The College Football Playoff was the baseline for this team. The regular season was supposed to be a series of scrimmages. Instead, this loaded group\u2019s season ended Saturday night in Death Valley on a gutsy, two-point conversion in overtime, LSU taking over the lead of the SEC West in dramatic fashion . Alabama won\u2019t even sniff the playoff this year, with two conference losses in the same season for just the second time since 2011. This is, without question, the most disappointing season of Nick Saban\u2019s dominance in Tuscaloosa, the earliest his team has been eliminated from the playoff since the system began eight years ago. It is unequivocally the low point of his dynastic tenure at Alabama. It raises questions if he has lost his fastball at the age of 71, Saban admitting Saturday night this was on him. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for all this stuff,\u201d he said. Really, Alabama is fortunate it only has two losses. It was outplayed by mediocre Texas, sans starting quarterback Quinn Ewers, in a narrow road win. It nearly lost at home to three-win Texas A&M. That high-scoring loss at Tennessee doesn\u2019t look as good after the Volunteers were manhandled by Georgia on Saturday . Had Alabama escaped LSU, and somehow run the table to earn a trip to the SEC title game, it would\u2019ve only been setting itself up to get destroyed by the far better and deeper Bulldogs. Quality offenses have exposed the defense. The offense has lacked a big-play receiver all year, asking Young to do everything. Alabama has been far too mistake-prone all season, a team that commits stupid penalties at the wrong times. There were nine infractions for 92 yards on Saturday and a whopping 17 for 130 yards in the loss at Tennessee. The result is this underwhelming season that could result in a third-place finish in the SEC West if Alabama can\u2019t win at Ole Miss on Saturday. Imagine that sentence in August or early September? Then again, this season hasn\u2019t played out how anyone, even the most die-hard Alabama haters, could have expected. For the first year in the history of the playoff, Clemson and Alabama won\u2019t be in it. The Tigers\u2019 only path was by going undefeated, and that ended in a humiliating 35-14 loss at average Notre Dame. Right now, there are two safe bets to reach the last four: Georgia and the Michigan/Ohio State winner. Then it gets really interesting. If TCU finishes undefeated it will get in. But that\u2019s no lock considering the Horned Frogs may be road underdogs the next two weeks. Oregon is now firmly in play if it wins out, particularly with a Pac-12 championship game win over USC. Tennessee has only one loss, albeit an ugly one at Georgia on Saturday, but would the committee take a team that failed to win its division over a one-loss Big 12 or Pac-12 champion? The wild card is LSU, which has two losses to Florida State and Tennessee. But if the Tigers, now the favorite to win the SEC West, get past Georgia in the conference title game, they would have an argument in that scenario as the first-ever two-loss team to reach the playoff. The best team doesn\u2019t always win. Upsets happen. Injuries can change outcomes. But Georgia on its \u201cA\u201d game is better than everyone else, and maybe by a significant margin. It destroyed Oregon, who hasn\u2019t lost since. The 27-13 margin on Saturday against previously undefeated Tennessee didn\u2019t accurately tell the story of this one-sided contest. The Bulldogs got bored midway through the season, unimpressive in wins over Kent State and Missouri, their two closest games of the season.

Tap or click here for my picks for the best Chromebooks and Windows and Mac laptops for every budget . Typing on laptop, file photo. (iStock) Let\u2019s look at the clear-cut signs buying a new laptop is in your immediate future. Sign 1: Your laptop is a slow poke I'm not just talking about web pages taking a little longer to load. I'm talking about when your laptop takes 10 minutes to turn on. Maybe you're running two programs at once, and everything slows down to a crawl. A laptop getting slower is mostly a sign of age. Of course, it could also mean you have malware or hackers on your device. Here\u2019s how to tell if your computer has been compromised . Laptops slow down as their memory fills up and when multiple applications are running at once. Sometimes you can speed up a computer by upgrading the CPU and RAM. You could save yourself a lot of money by upgrading your hardware. My rule of thumb: When the cost to upgrade or fix an old laptop is 30% of the price of a new one, buy a new one. RELATED: Want to keep your computer running smoothly for a long time? Tap or click here for 7 essential maintenance tips to keep your laptop happy . Sign 2: It\u2019s hot Laptops come with built-in fans to keep cool. You may have heard the fan whirring when your machine has been running for a long time. It's trying to make the toasty device drop a few degrees in your lap. Over time, these fans can get full of dust and debris \u2014 or they're just worn down. When this happens, your laptop will still heat up, but now it can't cool itself down. HP Chromebook 13 G1 (Hewlett-Packard) Ultimately, this kind of heating up signifies that you should replace your laptop. If your computer gets hot enough, it will cease to function. Consistent overheating can even lead to breakage or even melting. Tap or click for 10 reasons your computer is running hot and how to fix them. Sign 3: It\u2019s a risk to use Count your blessings if your laptop is more than four to five years old . One downside: Often, using an old machine is a considerable cybersecurity risk. Software updates are critical for your digital health. Operating system updates come with new features that make life easier, but they also patch bugs that hackers exploit. For example, you're in danger if you're still using Windows 7. Microsoft doesn't update that OS anymore. Windows 10 or 11 get frequent updates, which means they have better cybersecurity protections. Dig through your settings to see which OS you\u2019re running. Research the latest update and see if your device can run it . If not, take this for what it is: One of the most prominent signs you need a new laptop. Sign 4: Your screen or your keyboard is busted Laptops are durable and made to take a beating. But even if you\u2019re careful, accidents happen . Your screen might be missing a few pixels. It can also start flickering for no apparent reason. Your laptop keyboard may be missing letters and numbers. Or perhaps certain keys no longer work at all. The trackpad may lose its sensitivity over time, too. Rather than replacing a laptop screen, you can save some money and hook an external monitor up to it. You could also do the same with a keyboard. Unless your laptop is less than three years old, repairing a screen or a keyboard is usually not the best decision. Sell it and apply that money towards purchasing a new laptop.

Sign 5: Your battery doesn\u2019t hold a charge Laptop batteries, like phone batteries, lose charge as you use them. Over time, your laptop will eventually need to be charged more often . This can escalate to the point where you must plug it in all the time to work. For many people, particularly those whose only computer is a laptop, keeping it powered up isn't that much of a hardship. Laptops should be portable, though. Not sure how your battery is faring?

Jim \"Mattress Mack\" McIngvale jumped for joy in his front-row seats at Minute Maid Park as the Astros clinched the World Series with a 4-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 6 on Saturday. It was the culmination of a six-month ride for the self-proclaimed \"huckster\" that began May 13, in the parking lot of a Louisiana restaurant, where McIngvale placed a $3 million bet on the Astros to win the World Series at 10-1 odds on Caesars Sportsbook's mobile app. \"What can we say? We just wrote the biggest check in sports betting history to Mattress Mack for $30,000,000,\" Ken Fuchs, chief operating officer for Caesars Digital, said in a company release Saturday night. The $3 million bet with Caesars was his largest, but not his only seven-figure bet on the Astros. He tacked on roughly $7 million more in bets on the Astros over the summer at various sportsbooks, and, with average payout odds of +750, won around $75 million. But he won't get to keep it all. McIngvale uses the betting market to mitigate risk on promotions at his Gallery Furniture store that are based on the winner of big sporting events, from the Super Bowl to the Final Four. His biggest promotions, though, have involved the Astros and the World Series. This year's deal offered to refund any customer who spent at least $3,000 on furniture double their money back if the Astros won the World Series. He'll use the $75 million from his winning bets to pay back happy customers who participated in the promotion and likely still turn a cushy profit. \"Oh, it's definitely a win-win,\" McIngvale told ESPN in a recent profile. \"These promotions just bring the brand to life and give us a ton of brand equity that we wouldn't have otherwise. The customers love it, so they're totally engaged and talk about it for years. Because it runs all season long, it probably ups the number of people following the Astros, too, because now they have a real vested interest in the team.\" Sportsbooks, however, especially bookmakers of smaller scale, weren't able to mitigate their risk from McIngvale's bets as successfully as Mack. Sportsbook Betfred, which had operated in the United Kingdom for decades, but only recently entered the U.S. market, took a $1 million bet on the Astros from McIngvale in Iowa at 5-1 odds. The $1 million bet was \"significantly larger\" than any other bet the company had taken since launching in the U.S., according to Betfred U.S. chief operating officer Bryan Bennett. \"I want to congratulate all you people in Texas, all you Houston Astros fans, and especially you, Mattress Mack,\" Fred Done, veteran owner of Betfred in the U.K., said in a video release from the company. \"You had the guts ... to put your money on the line. You put $1 million dollars on the Astros with me at five-to-one. They won.

The Brooklyn Nets star forward follows the Commanders religiously and is waiting to see what happens with owner Dan Snyder's potential sale of the team. The Commanders announced earlier this week that Snyder and his wife, Tanya (a team co-owner), have hired Bank of America Securities \"to explore potential transactions involving the team.\" \"In a perfect world, I would be a part of it,\" Durant told ESPN. \"I would love to do it. I would love to give a little bit of my money to be a part of the Commanders, but we'll see. Hopefully it's somebody nice. I heard [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos and Jay-Z, but you never know.\" A person with knowledge of the situation told ESPN's John Keim that Bezos has interest in the team, with multiple reports saying Jay-Z might partner with a Bezos bid. Mat Ishbia, a finalist for the Denver Broncos' ownership bid, released a statement expressing interest, as well. Byron Allen, who also made a bid on the Broncos, has also said he'd be interested. Durant, who was born and raised in the D.C. area, said he was surprised to hear that Snyder appears to be on the verge of selling the team. \"I mean, how long has he had it now -- 20-something years?\" Durant said. \"He's probably the only owner I've known since I've been alive for the Redskins/Commanders. So it's definitely shocking to see him put them up because it's his baby. NFL teams are precious, they're important. \"But that's going to be a team that everybody -- everybody wants to be a part of the league. It's one of the most lucrative teams in sports, so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of bidders.\" Durant says he views the Commanders as a sleeping giant within the NFL and believes the young pieces are in place for Washington to start winning games consistently. The Nets' social media account posted a video of Durant giving his jersey to Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin after Friday's win over the Washington Wizards. \"Our market is incredible,\" Durant said. \"There's a lot of support in D.C., a lot of money in D.C. to be made. I feel like we drafted well the last couple years. We got some foundation pieces that can help you win football games moving forward. So yeah, I think it's an attractive destination. Regardless of what's going on, they pretty much built that team up, built that stadium, built the brand up pretty nicely. \"I know we've had some losing seasons, but it's starting to come around for us. I'm excited as a fan. I'm excited about the sale. I'm excited to see who they bring in and who they sell the team to and see how we move forward with it.\" Durant does have some experience already being part of an ownership group for a professional sports team. In 2020, he bought a 5% stake in the Philadelphia Union of the MLS, with the option to buy another 5%. He became a minority owner of the club NY/NJ Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League in March. In October, he became a co-owner of a pickleball team, alongside business partner Rich Kleiman. In the past he has discussed his desire of having an NBA team of his own once his career ends, potentially helping bring a team back to Seattle, but he says the potential to be part of the Washington ownership group hits closer to home. \"I would probably stay more of a fan than try to get involved with the team,\" Durant said of being part of a Commanders ownership group. \"And it would be something nice for my family, and just to have in our family, that would be incredible to be a part of that group. Just get a little closer to the team if I were to be able to be in that position. Try to learn the business, try to learn from an ownership's perspective and a front-office perspective, coach's perspective, try to get closer to players.\" Durant is trying not to get his hopes up, though. He demurred when it was suggested that his name and accomplishments would likely be welcome from a variety of potential new ownership groups. He knows that for as much money as he has made in and out of basketball, it doesn't come close to the amount of money that other potential suitors for the Commanders have. \"Of course,\" he said with a smile when asked whether he'd like to be part of a potential ownership group. \"I don't have a lot of money, though. I don't have that much money to say, 'Look, man, let me get a piece of the team.' So I'm sure it would have to work out some way, somehow. I would love to, obviously, but to be honest, I doubt that it'll happen.

Is it when people break out in song a la Glee ? Or is it when there\u2019s one or two music-video-like interludes per episode? A new series on BBC America has musical segments, but they\u2019re absolutely not intrusive. So is it a musical? Opening Shot: We pan across a cityscape \u2014 probably London \u2014 and the buildings shrink and expand depending on what part of the picture it\u2019s in. The Gist: Sasha Clayton (Nic\u00f4le Lecky) is making a music video, singing one of her original songs. Then the vision switches to her shouting in a phone, then her boyfriend Anton Mills (Jordan Duvigneau) giving her a key. Then flashes of her getting kicked out of a club, and her jacket sleeve on fire. This is when Sasha wakes up in her room at her parents\u2019 house, hungover and not quite sure of what happened the previous night. Her mother Laura (Jessica Hynes) and stepfather Kevin (Paul Kaye) are alarmed when a police officer arrives at their door, asking Sasha questions about a fire in the front yard of Anton\u2019s house. Sasha denies everything. As she tries to retrace the night via her many texts to Anton, she goes with her friend Saleem (Mohamed Moses Dalmar), a weed dealer, to one of his customers, an social media influencer named Carly (Lara Peake), who invites her to a club event with free booze and the possibility of getting in front of industry people. Back at home, she gets into it with Kevin, who is tired of her self-indulgent act; after he informs them that their moving out of the house without her and it\u2019s time for her to finally grow up and admit to what happened with Anton, she gets into a scuffle with her sister Megan (Mia Jenkins). She then and decides to pack up and leave. Sasha goes to the event, and Carly tries to convince her to increase her social media presence; if she wants to make it as a singer, the only way to do it these days is to be an influencer. One of her ex-roommates warns Sasha that Carly is \u201ca lot\u201d and to be careful. As Sasha tries to figure out where she can spend the night, memories of the previous night come back to her: She\u2019s begging Anton to take her back after he dumped her, then she drunkenly did what she was accused of, including setting her jacket on fire. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? The musical style of Mood reminds us of the recent series Jungle , which takes place in a near-future version of London. Our Take: Nic\u00f4le Lecky created Mood based on her one-woman show, and it shows in her performance as Sasha. She\u2019s not making Sasha a sympathetic figure; she\u2019s making her someone who\u2019s struggling to break out and make a name for herself \u2014 like she says to Saleem, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to play, I came to slay.\u201d Yes, she makes her stepfather Kevin look like a big ol\u2019 dork when he says that everyone in Sasha\u2019s generation wants to take shortcuts to \u201cbecome the next Lisa Stansfield,\u201d a name Sasha doesn\u2019t recognize. But Sasha isn\u2019t really fighting against her parents; she\u2019s fighting her own inertia and worst tendencies. We\u2019d like to see how she gets away with setting fire to Anton\u2019s house, and we\u2019d also like to see her figure out how her continual pursuit of him is probably the worst thing she can do for herself. As she connects with Carly and gets deeper into the world of being a social media influcencer, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Sasha gets so involved that she loses the reasons why she did it in the first place, which is to promote her singing career. It doesn\u2019t feel like Mood is going to be some sort of morality tale, where Lecky is trying to demonstrate how empty being an influencer can be. Instead, it feels more like a journey for Sasha, told through the one or two songs we\u2019ll get to listen to per episode. Will she become even more of a mess than she was, will she find herself in a different place in life than she wanted to be in, or will she come full circle and finally achieve what she wanted to achieve with her singing? Either way, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how she gets to wherever she\u2019s going. Sex and Skin: None, in the first episode. Parting Shot: Over the credits we see a lengthy video message from a drunken Sasha to Anton, where she curses him out, then begs him to call her back. Sleeper Star: We\u2019ll give it to Paul Kay for saying the Lisa Stansfield line with a straight face. Most Pilot-y Line: \u201cFucking psychos\u2026\u201d Sasha says as Saleem and his buddy drive off. Not sure what she\u2019s basing it on. They seem like standard-grade drug dealers to us. Our Call: STREAM IT. Mood is one of those shows that takes you on a ride with its main character. It\u2019s a ride we think is worth taking, but it all depends on how much you relate with Sasha and the decisions she\u2019s making for herself.

The incidents occurred at a football game between the Cardinal and Washington State Cougars on Saturday and correlate directly to a larger conversation about social life suppression on campus.

The school\u2019s student newspaper The Stanford Daily provides a great look at the entire situation from a first-hand perspective. Tensions continue to mount over the university\u2019s handling of social life. The Stanford Hates Fun movement was born because of the administrative crackdown.

(Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports) During Stanford\u2019s home football game against Arizona State, the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band \u2014 which is notoriously goofy and puts fun at the forefront \u2014 unfurled a banner alongside the school\u2019s legendary Tree mascot. It read, simply, \u2018STANFORD HATES FUN.\u2019 In response to the sign, Jordan Zietz was from the band. Zietz was wearing the tree suit and helped to hold the banner. Despite an initial tweet claiming otherwise , he was suspended by the Band Executive Committee, not the university. The committee told The Stanford Daily that they decided to suspended Zietz \"because of his use of the platform for personal benefit without going through or inquiring about appropriate processes.\" It said that the decision was unrelated to the \u2018War On Fun.\u2019 However, it is hard to imagine that Stanford was not breathing down the committee\u2019s neck. Would the same decision have been made without mounting university pressure? Regardless of who made the decision, it only increased the anti-administration narrative. The Stanford Hates Fun movement ramped up even more. Students claim the university suppressed their free speech on Saturday.

(Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports) While the \u2018War On Fun\u2019 continues, a fairly large group of Stanford students \u2014 especially in relation to the minimal, practically nonexistent crowd elsewhere in the stands \u2014 were in attendance at the Cardinal\u2019s blowout loss to Washington State. Many of them wore #FreeTheTree shirts, others wore shirts in support of Stanford Hates Fun. They also held up the initial sign that ultimately resulted in the Tree\u2019s suspension. As they did, security converged on the student section. AT LEAST 5 HURT AFTER COASTAL CAROLINA CROWD STORMS FIELD FOLLOWING UPSET WIN OVER APPALACHIAN STATE Video from the game appears to show an increased presence of armed police and unarmed campus security for a game with a very small crowd. Many of them were positioned at and/or around the student entrances. Stanford Hates Fun claims that the issue goes deeper. It claims that Stanford violated its free speech responsibilities under California\u2019s Leonard Law and plans to \"follow up through the appropriate legal channels.\" The group says that students were restricted from entering the football game with anti-administration signs and banners, regardless of size or format. Signs are not prohibited at the football. Nov 5, 2022; Stanford, California, USA; Stanford Cardinal fans hold up a sign during halftime against the Washington State Cougars at Stanford Stadium. (Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports) Stanford Stadium has posted a list of prohibited items online and at the entrance, and the list does not include signage. At a game earlier this month, stadium staff even handed out signs to spectators. However, the students\u2019 signs were not allowed on Saturday. \"When we asked why they were prohibiting signs, we received different answers from different staff. We therefore have reason to believe that these signs were prohibited specifically because of their content,\" Stanford Hates Fun told OutKick. Stanford Hates Fun also claims that security made students partially disrobe to confirm that they were not carrying any signage. Images from the game show students being confronted by officers as they tried to enter the stadium. One banner was brought into the game. However, it came through a non-student entrance. The Stanford Hates Fun group believes that the security at other entrances were \"not briefed on the planned censorship.\" Security and Stanford administrators attempted to remove the banner, but were deterred by the crowd\u2019s support. The replacement mascot installed by the administration also wore a shirt that said \"Stanford Hates Fun.\" In addition, many band members chose to boycott the band on Saturday. Many of the band members who did play during the game protested with the \u2018Stanford Hates Fun\u2019 slogan brandished on their t-shirts and instruments.

When conflicts arise, the first questions must be: Can you solve this dispute peacefully? Can you talk it out?

You must always strive for peace with everything you\u2019ve got. 14-YEAR-OLD WORLD WAR II ENLISTEE OFFERS LESSONS ON REBUILDING A DIVIDE AMERICA Guard against hostilities Hostilities exist. President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke those two powerful words within his legendary \"Day of Infamy\" speech to Congress, Dec. 8, 1941, one day after Pearl Harbor. America rallied to arm itself, safeguard its citizens, and take action against the hostilities that threatened. FDR\u2019s words are as true today as 81 years ago. Hostilities exist. They just exist in different forms. The world isn\u2019t always a safe place. Regretfully, as children, you need to know that not everyone around the world loves you or your country. President Franklin D. Roosevelt at his desk in the White House, May 7, 1933. (Associated Press) Do your duty You and your generation may need to fight. If a country or terrorist group rises up and attacks your country or another country or people group, then national (and sometimes international) defense is a must. Think of it this way: Two kids are fighting on the playground, and you know it\u2019s best to stay out of it. But what if one child is bullied by a mean kid? You\u2019d want to stop the bully, either by yourself or by calling a teacher to intervene. History has shown that policies of isolationism and nonintervention (not getting involved in other people\u2019s battles), sometimes work on an international scale but at other times don\u2019t. The sidewalks of lower Broadway are jammed as the motorcade of Gen. Jonathan Wainwright goes north toward City Hall in 1945. (World Telegram & Sun photo by Al Aumuller/Retrieved from the Library of Congress) After the First World War , much of America adopted a live and let live stance. We\u2019d had enough. We were determined not to get involved in a second international dispute that didn\u2019t seem to directly affect us. So when World War II broke out, we hung back at the edges at first. Yet hindsight has shown that isolationism prolonged World War II, causing more death and destruction than it prevented. The World War II veterans I\u2019ve interviewed said that when they reached Europe and the Pacific, respectively, people responded with a loud: \"What took you so long?\" Remember that war is always horrible Triumphant iconic images of victory can offer big learning moments.

U.S. Marines of the 28th Regiment, 5th Division, raise the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima, on Feb. 23, 1945. (Associated Press) Other images of war, the mixed images, even the bloody and ghoulish, can provide big learning moments too. As you grow, you\u2019ll be able to see more of how truly horrible war is. When young soldiers go off to war, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re football players rushing onto the field for the big game. War is not a pep rally. War is vicious hell . It\u2019s to be avoided whenever possible because it\u2019s always highly destructive.

After the COVID-19 lockdowns prevented the possibility of in-person concerts, Christian music star and country singer-songwriter Matthew West wanted to connect with his fans again. He remembered having to \"pivot and get creative\" during the height of the pandemic by putting on virtual concerts. Now that he and his fans are able to come together in one place again, and partly due to his love of the holidays, West came up with the idea of hosting a Christmas event: Come Home for Christmas. \"We had this idea of building an event in Nashville where we could invite people who would watch those virtual concerts to come to my city and have a Christmas weekend with us, and we decided we'll call it Come Home for Christmas,\" West explained to Fox News Digital. \"In early December, we're going to have about 400 people descend upon Nashville, and we're going have a special Christmas celebration weekend together. No more virtual, but in person.\" Once West had the idea for the event, he was inspired to write a song, which he also called \"Come Home for Christmas.\" The five-time Grammy nominated artist admitted he had never \"had an event inspire a song before, but (he's) sure glad it did.\" Matthew West is excited to get back on stage and put on in person shows again. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images for SiriusXM) MATTHEW WEST PERFORMS HIS NEW SONG 'UNPLANNED' West explained that the track ended up becoming the theme song for the holiday season for the Great American Family Network after a conversation he had with his friend and actress, Candace Cameron Bure. The two were speaking about a movie Bure was working on, which resulted in West playing the song for her. \"Candace was working on a new movie for the Great American Family Network, and she texted me, and she's like, \u2018I want a song for the movie,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Well, I can send you this,\u2019\" he recalled. \"She heard it, and she's like, \u2018I love this song so much. I want to send it to the head of the network.\u2019 She sent the song to the head of the network and lo and behold, the song wasn't right for the movie, but the head of the network said, 'We want this to be the theme of our whole network for the holidays.\" He ended up collaborating with Bure to write the song, noting that once Bure explained the message of the film, he was able to write \"another song for the movie that fit the theme better.\" The two had been friends since 2011, when Bure starred in the movie \"The Heart of Christmas,\" which was based off West's song of the same name. West joked it was almost a no-brainer that Bure had a starring role in that movie, because \"she's kind of the queen of Christmas,\" having starred in many throughout her career.

I played the part of the friendly neighbor, and I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty sure I knocked it out of the park.\" While he believes he did a good job in the film, he admits to not really enjoying the acting part of the job, and would much rather stick to his roots and \"be the one reading the script and writing a song about it.\" West is excited to not only be able to go back to his roots and connect with his fans again through the weekend-long Come Home for Christmas event, he is also excited to show them some of his favorite parts about living in Tennessee and to share that experience with them for the first time. \"There's a little town, Franklin, Tennessee, outside of Nashville that is like Christmas magic . Thousands of people show up for the Christmas tree lighting, and they've had me be the one who officiates that every year,\" he said. \"I always wish people could experience the magic of this little town, and now they're going to get to do that. So we're going to have [a] special, you know, Christmas carol nights, Christmas party [and] then some surprise concerts and [a] surprise guest joining me as well.\" Matthew West has been influenced by artists from every decade but mostly artists who are both singer-songwriters. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images) In terms of musical influences, West said he is influenced by older artists he grew up listening to on the radio, but also from newer artists he has heard, noting \"there's influences from every decade of music\" that he feels like he can \"draw from.\" \"I mean the greats. The great singer-songwriters are the first ones that I would point to, whether it's \u2018So It Goes\u2019 by Billy Joel or \u2018Fire and Rain\u2019 by James Taylor, some of the great singer-songwriters of the day,\" West explained. \"A lot of faith based inspirational music as well, like Michael W Smith and Steven Curtis Chapman and DC Talk really impacted the type of music that I decided I wanted to make.

It is the coolest thing,\" West explained. \"There's so many great artists that let me be part of their creative process, and I get just as much joy out of that being behind the scenes.\" West has lots coming up in the future that he is excited about, including a new book and a new album that he cannot wait for his fans to listen to.

It will be the Chargers\u2019 top-four passing offense (279.4 yards per game) against a Falcons defense that is dead last against the pass (306.9 yards). Los Angeles\u2019 ideal scenario: Use the pass for an early lead and work on their anemic rushing attack. But will QB Justin Herbert have enough healthy receivers to thrive? Expected to be a top AFC team, the Chargers are all over the place this season, although they have been hit hard by injuries. They have four victories, but their losses have made noise, like one to the Seahawks in Week 7 and a non-competitive setback to the Jaguars. Even if wideouts Allen and Mike Williams don\u2019t play, Herbert has figured out how to compile copious amounts of passing yards. It\u2019s his ability to find the end zone that has taken a hit. He had nine TD passes in the first four games but just three since. The Falcons give up 25.6 points per game, fourth worst in the NFL, so neither defense is all that elite. On the other side, the Chargers\u2019 offense is head and shoulders ahead of the Falcons, whose 162.6 passing yards per game are fourth worst in the league. Chargers vs. Falcons prediction: Chargers -3, -120 at Caesars Sportsbook When two of the four worst scoring defenses meet, points are expected. The issue then is whether or not this is all somehow a false flag. The Chargers scored 19 points in Week 6, but that was against a strong Broncos defense. It is their lowest scoring game of the season. The Chargers score points when they are expected. They are one of the 10 worst scoring defenses and they have faced four of the other nine teams on that list: Browns, Seahawks, Raiders, Chiefs. In those four games, Los Angeles averaged 25.3 points. The Falcons are coming off a 37-point game against the Panthers, or 34 when not considering overtime. That was well over what Carolina has given up per game: 23.3 points. Of minor concern is that two of Atlanta\u2019s lowest-scoring games have come in the past four weeks. Chargers vs. Falcons prediction: Over 49.5 total points, -110 at Caesars Sportsbook Of Herbert\u2019s four multi-touchdown passing games, only one has come in the Chargers\u2019 past three games. But that one did come in their most recent game against the Seahawks. The bye week gives L.A. a chance to make a game plan to build on that contest. What the Chargers need to do at some point is to work on their rushing attack. But what the Falcons actually do well is deny the run. Atlanta\u2019s 108.9 rushing yards allowed per game is 11th best in the NFL. L.A.\u2019s breakthrough with the run game might have to wait. The Chargers might be uncertain with their wide-receiver personnel due to injuries, but they are adept at using running back Austin Ekeler in the passing game. Expect the Chargers to treat Sunday as a must-win game, especially with a challenging schedule ahead.

The Bears continue to lead the league in rushing with 1,507 yards behind the three-headed monster of quarterback Justin Fields and running backs David Montgomery and Khalil Herbert. But a struggling defense made those efforts mostly moot in Dallas. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa passed for 382 yards and three touchdowns at Detroit, as receivers Tyreek Hill (12 catches, 188 yards) and Jaylen Waddle (eight catches, 106 yards, two touchdowns) enjoyed big days yet again. The duo now has 1,688 combined receiving yards through eight games, a record for two teammates during the Super Bowl era. Next up: the Bears, who traded linebacker and league-leading tackler Roquan Smith this week, not long after shopping defensive end Robert Quinn. Miami made some trades of its own, landing linebacker Bradley Chubb and running back Jeff Wilson. Between established offensive stars and defenders that can pressure Chicago quarterback Justin Fields, the Dolphins look to move the ball while enjoying strong field position. Dolphins vs. Bears prediction: Dolphins over 25.5 points, @ -110 via BetMGM New Bears wide receiver Chase Claypool called himself \u201ca dynamic playmaker\u201d when meeting the media this week, not far removed from his acquisition from Pittsburgh. While the move may not fully shift the run-first Bears from their offensive mantra, it figures to get the incumbent Darnell Mooney stirring. After snagging a mere four receptions in September, Mooney had a far stronger October, closing the month by catching all five of his targets against Dallas for 70 yards. Look for Claypool not only to make splashes in the passing game himself, but also help free attention from Mooney as the Bears try to keep the Dolphins\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 honest. Dolphins vs. Bears prediction: Darnell Mooney over 42.5 receiving yards, @ -120 via BetMGM You\u2019ve just read about the prolific exploits of Hill and Waddle, but the Dolphins shouldn\u2019t forget they\u2019re encountering a Bears defense that has struggled to stop the run, too. Entering Week 9, Chicago has yielded the second-most rush yards in the league (1,248), while its opponents\u2019 yards per carry (5.0) is 27th. Miami\u2019s Raheem Mostert is averaging 4.5 yards per carry and facing a \u2018D\u2019 that recently has dealt two standouts from its front seven.

By letting go of offensive coordinator Marcus Brady, putting their faith in 24-year-old quarterback Sam Ehlinger and dealing Nyheim Hines to the Buffalo Bills, the Colts are hoping the changes in scenery will propel them in the right direction. Beating New England will be no simple task, though, as the Patriots have won six of their last seven meetings with Indianapolis. However, injuries to New England playmakers such as running back Damien Harris, receiver DeVante Parker and safety Devin McCourty could allow the Colts to begin the new era with a victory. Two NFL teams should easily be able to combine for at least 40 points, right? Well, that might not necessarily be the case here. Indianapolis is scoring just 16.1 points per game, while New England averages just a tick over 21. But with injuries to offensive weapons on both sides \u2014 most notably Colts running back Jonathan Taylor (ankle) \u2014 don\u2019t expect either of these teams to reach those marks. The under is a stunning 13-3 in Indianapolis\u2019 last 16 games in addition to hitting in 10 of the Colts\u2019 last 11 games against AFC opponents. Chances are New England will be running the ball quite a bit, too, assuming it can build a sizable lead, meaning time will fly off the clock to help the under soar in. Patriots vs. Colts: Under 40 total points @ -110 with Caesars Sportsbook While it might be risky to bet on a guy who only has one two-touchdown game in his career, a lot of pieces are falling into place that could lead to Pittman having a massive day. With Taylor\u2019s ankle injury and Hines now in Buffalo, look for Colts coach Frank Reich to lean heavily on the passing game, especially if Indianapolis is trailing. The Colts average the fourth-most pass attempts per game (40.0), and that\u2019s a trend that could continue if Reich wants to make sure Ehlinger is getting valuable reps. In addition to McCourty, the Patriots are also dealing with injuries to safeties Kyle Dugger and Adrian Phillips, further hampering the secondary. Pittman has been targeted at least eight times in six of his seven games this season and is destined to carry a large workload on Sunday. If he does go for two scores, it will likely come at the expense of the under, but you\u2019ll make more than enough profit to make up for that loss. Patrioits vs. Colts pick: Michael Pittman Jr. to score at least two touchdowns @ +1500 with Caesars Sportsbook Bill Belichick typically goes with a running back by committee approach, but lately it seems like he\u2019s been trusting Stevenson to handle most of the work on the ground. Stevenson has tallied at least 11 carries in each of the last six games and if Harris plays, he likely won\u2019t be 100 percent due to an illness that forced him to miss practice on Wednesday. The Colts\u2019 defense hasn\u2019t been anything special when it comes to stopping the run, either, allowing 120 rushing yards per game. Take this line while you can. Stevenson might still pass as an underrated back in this league for now, but he\u2019s turning heads week after week, which will eventually lead to his yardage totals rising.

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department told CNN it responded to a call for help at Carter\u2019s Lancaster, California, home on Saturday morning around 11 a.m. local time, where a deceased person was found. Nick Carter\u2019s tribute followed another by his sister, Aaron\u2019s twin Angel, who wrote on Instagram , \u201cTo my twin\u2026 I loved you beyond measure.\u201d \u201cMy funny, sweet Aaron, I have so many memories of you and I, and I promise to cherish them.

The Tigers have fallen in national title games, CFP semifinals and five times during the regular season. But arguably no defeat felt as complete and deflating as the 35-14 loss Saturday to unranked Notre Dame. No. 4 Clemson fell behind 28-0, surrendered 263 rushing yards and allowed touchdowns on defense, offense and special teams. The Tigers avoided their first shutout since 2003 but did not score until 10:14 remained in the game. \"This was an ass-kicking, period,\" Swinney said. \"That's what it is. Just flat-out got our tails handed to us. That's unfortunate. It hasn't happened a lot, but it's happened a few times along the way. We've handed out a bunch of them, too. Tonight, we were the bug. We got the bad end of that deal, and we deserved every second of it.\" Clemson suffered its worst loss to an unranked opponent since falling by 24 to NC State in 2011. Although Clemson had to rally to beat Syracuse and remain undefeated Oct. 22, the team had an extra week to prepare for Notre Dame, which had fallen to Marshall and Stanford on its home field. \"This was a really bad day and all the criticism was warranted and just should be directed at me, period,\" Swinney said. \"This is one of the most disappointing days that I've had as a head coach.\" Notre Dame struck first after recording its FBS-leading sixth punt block, which Prince Kollie returned for a touchdown. The Irish then hammered away against a Clemson defense that came in ranked No. 7 nationally against the run, allowing only 3 yards per carry. Clemson quarterbacks DJ Uiagalelei and Cade Klubnik both threw interceptions that led to Notre Dame touchdowns, including an Uiagalelei throw that cornerback Benjamin Morrison returned 96 yards to the end zone early in the fourth quarter. \"We gave up a score on offense, a score on special teams and a score on defense, that's the first time that's happened since I've been a head coach,\" said Swinney, in his 14th full season as Clemson's coach. \"We just got out-coached in every facet of the game. That's on me. It's my responsibility. And I wish I could say I saw it coming. We had a great week of practice.\" Notre Dame running backs Logan Diggs and Audric Estime both eclipsed 100 rushing yards against Clemson, which struggled to cover gaps and was often sealed on the perimeter. \"Obviously, we were not the most physical team, that's 100 percent on me, getting them prepared the right way,\" defensive coordinator Wes Goodwin said. \"It was a combination of things, guys getting knocked out of a gap, [linebackers] falling back in the wrong gap, missed tackles as well. We'll own it and move on.\" Despite being benched in the Syracuse win, Uiagalelei started for Clemson and completed his first seven pass attempts, but only for 33 yards in windy conditions. He had just 41 pass yards in the first half and was replaced by Klubnik late in the third quarter with Clemson down 14-0. Uiagalelei returned to Notre Dame Stadium, where he made his first career start in 2020 and had 439 passing yards, a record for an opposing player against the Irish. Klubnik, who entered with Clemson at its own 7-yard line, had his only pass attempt intercepted by Morrison. Notre Dame scored three plays later. \"Whenever you come out the game, you want to be the biggest supporter, and give all the knowledge you can to my brother Cade,\" Uiagalelei said. \"He's going to be great. Quarterbacks, we all make mistakes, but he's going to be a great ballplayer. The biggest thing I love about Cade is he's aggressive.\" Swinney said he was trying to spark the offense with Klubnik, who \"was trying to make a play\" when he threw across his body and was intercepted. Uiagalelei finished with 191 pass yards, 113 in the fourth quarter, but was sacked four times in the loss. \"Thought he held the ball a couple of times and just took a couple bad sacks where the protection was there,\" Swinney said. \"You've got to get rid of the ball. ... I thought DJ responded. He went back in and did some good things.\" Swinney said Clemson will evaluate personnel and other areas after the loss but noted, \"It's not all on DJ.\" Clemson hosts Louisville next week with the chance to win the ACC Atlantic Division outright. In 2021, the Tigers saw their streak of CFP appearances and ACC championships both end at six. \"There's not a single goal that's not there for us,\" Swinney said. \"I know everybody wants to win the national championship, and we don't control that. But what we do control is try to win this division, try to win the league, the state championship and win the closer, whatever that is. \"When you do those things, you have a heck of a year.\"", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-25.366302490234375, -5.900043964385986]}, {"title": "Georgia 'Blue Alert' suspect still on the run after investigators discover car", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-blue-alert-suspect-still-run-investigators-discover-car", "description": "Investigators have located the car a man at the center of a \"Blue Alert\" in Georgia allegedly took off from the scene of a shooting that left a detention officer injured and another person dead.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for November 5 Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

The Packers made aggressive attempts to acquire Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Chase Claypool and Las Vegas Raiders tight end Darren Waller, league sources told ESPN. Green Bay offered two draft picks -- its second-round pick and another late-round pick -- to Pittsburgh for Claypool, according to sources. The Steelers believed, however, that the Packers are capable of turning around their season even without Claypool, according to sources, and a playoff push by Green Bay would decrease the value of the picks Pittsburgh would have received in the trade. So the Steelers ultimately opted for the Bears' offer of a second-round pick, even though Green Bay offered more picks than Chicago. The Packers also revisited their interest in Waller, whom they tried to acquire this past offseason when they traded Davante Adams to the Raiders. Green Bay asked the Raiders to include Waller in any package for Adams, but Las Vegas declined, according to sources. The Packers checked back with the Raiders before the deadline to see if they had any interest in dealing Waller this time, but Green Bay wasn't willing to offer enough trade compensation to Las Vegas for the Pro Bowl tight end, according to sources. Acquiring the 6-foot-4 Claypool was the primary focus, however, for the Packers, who did not express interest in trading for Houston Texans wide receiver Brandin Cooks, according to sources. Multiple teams aggressively pursued a trade for Claypool, but it appeared as if Green Bay would land the third-year receiver. But talks between the Steelers and Bears heated up Monday, and Pittsburgh eventually dealt Claypool to Chicago, which has been looking to add weapons for quarterback Justin Fields just as Green Bay has been trying to do for Aaron Rodgers. Claypool, who is expected to make his Bears debut Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, had 32 catches for 311 yards and a touchdown in eight games for the Steelers this season.

Men ages 18 to 60 are as a rule not able to leave because they may be needed for military service. Jodi Hilton for NPR hide caption Olha and Ihor were determined to remain in Ukraine even while many of their neighbors fled. They believed the war would end quickly. But one starry and particularly quiet night in March, they heard an eerie whistling sound. They soon learned that Russia had attacked the nearby city of Lviv, where Olha had made her debut at the Lviv National Opera almost a decade ago. That was when they decided to leave. Today, Olha and her daughter are living in a leafy suburb of Boston with Olha's sister, Liliia Kachura, and her family. Liliia moved to the U.S. eight years ago and now lives in Sudbury, Mass., with her Ukrainian-born husband, Sasha Verbitsky, and their two young sons. Olha Abakumova and her daughter, Zlata, 8, now live with Olha's sister in a suburb of Boston. Jodi Hilton for NPR hide caption Olha Abakumova and her daughter, Zlata, 8, now live with Olha's sister in a suburb of Boston. In late April, President Biden announced the Uniting for Ukraine program , which allows U.S. citizens to sponsor Ukrainians to come to the U.S. When Verbitsky heard about it, he immediately called Olha, encouraging her to apply. Men of military age still have to remain in the country, so Ihor would stay in Ukraine. Within a few weeks, Olha's application was approved. In May, mother and daughter were on a 14-hour bus journey from Khmelnytskyi to Warsaw. Olha and Zlata carried one small suitcase. In it they put toiletries, clothes and shoes. They also carried a few items with sentimental value: Olha's mother's 50-year-old Vyshyvanka, a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt; Zlata's favorite stuffed animal, a turtle; and \u2014 most important for Olha \u2014 as much sheet music as Olha could stuff inside. \"I have a lot of different Ukrainian and Russian music, but when I fled, I took only the Ukrainian arias,\" says opera singer Olha Abakumova. \"The Ukrainian works are very important to me.

Soon after, Olha found a free piano advertised on Facebook. Verbitsky and Kachura arranged to get the piano for Olha's birthday. It's now in the children's playroom, where she practices and sings with her sheet music from Ukraine. Olha Abakumova unfurls some of her Ukrainian sheet music. She was able to find a piano \u2014 free on Facebook \u2014 for her new home in a Boston suburb, where she practices her Ukrainian arias.

You walked through thorns to reach the dreamed-about stars. You planted goodness in souls, like grains in the soil. This past August, hundreds of Ukrainians gathered in a churchyard in Boston to celebrate their Independence Day. Olha came dressed in a mint-colored Vyshyvanka. When she sang the Ukrainian national anthem, people stopped what they were doing and stood at attention. Olha Abakumova sang her country's national anthem at the Ukrainian Independence Day celebration held in August at Christ the King Ukrainian Church in Boston. Jodi Hilton for NPR hide caption Olha Abakumova sang her country's national anthem at the Ukrainian Independence Day celebration held in August at Christ the King Ukrainian Church in Boston. Her melodic voice carried across the churchyard, past a jungle gym full of playing children, through the tents where vendors were selling Ukrainian souvenirs and T-shirts. People who had been heaping their plates with homemade cabbage rolls, pierogis and sausages paused to listen. In August, Zlata celebrated her birthday in the U.S. with her mother, aunt, uncle and cousins. But her father, Ihor, could only congratulate his daughter over video chat from Khmelnytskyi. Olha worries about her family still in Ukraine, some of them fighting on the front lines, and dreams of a reunion. \"I hope the war will end soon,\" she says. \"I believe it will, but at what cost?\" Jodi Hilton is a Boston area photojournalist.

The United Nations says a multi-year drought in East Africa is evidence of \"mounting and ever-increasing climate risks.\" Sally Hayden/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty hide caption As the United Nations climate conference opens in Egypt, the most critical talks will likely focus on the soaring costs of limiting \u2014 and adapting to \u2014 global warming, especially in the world's most vulnerable countries. It's a contentious conversation more than a decade in the making. In 2009, industrialized countries pledged to provide developing nations with $100 billion a year in climate financing by 2020. The agreement is rooted in the fact that developed countries generated most of the heat-trapping pollution now in the atmosphere, while developing nations have already begun to bear a disproportionate share of the harm from extreme weather. That 2020 deadline came and went without rich countries delivering on their promises. Global efforts to limit climate change are in jeopardy without more aid, experts say. Developing countries need money to move to renewable energy so that their economies can grow without driving up greenhouse gas emissions. They also need funding to deal with the impacts they're already facing from rising temperatures. Scientists say it's likely climate change helped fuel floods in Pakistan that killed at least 1500 people this summer, and that it contributed to torrential rain that triggered floods and landslides in South Africa . Now, rampant inflation and an energy crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine could complicate efforts to convince developed nations to make good on their financial commitments. That's to say nothing of the need to boost future obligations in line with the trillions of dollars that developing countries will actually need to prepare for a hotter Earth. \"The challenge is going to be, how do we maintain momentum when there are so many short-term crises and pressures, and yet the climate crisis is intensifying?\" says Amar Bhattacharya, who is part of an independent group of experts that was convened ahead of COP27 to advise conference leaders on how to increase climate financing. Despite the turmoil, rich countries face pressure to come up with the money they promised in order to keep developing nations on board with efforts to cut global emissions, says Bella Tonkonogy, a director at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that works with governments and businesses to promote economic growth while addressing climate change. \"Developed countries know that if we are to reach our global emissions reduction targets that everybody has signed up to, that developed countries need to have credibility and need to have trust established with developing countries,\" says Tonkonogy. \"And this question of finance is one of, if not the most critical components of establishing that trust.\" The latest tally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows developing countries received $83.3 billion from public and private sources in 2020. But even with the financing provided so far, there have been problems and stumbling blocks. The bulk of the money is being delivered through loans, which critics say add to the debt burden of governments that are already on shaky financial footing. Mia Amor Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, has said developing nations should at least have access to loans on the same favorable terms that were offered to their counterparts in the developed world. \"We have incurred debts for COVID, we have incurred debts for climate, and we have incurred debts now in order to fight this difficult moment with the inflationary crisis and with the absence of certainty of supply of goods,\" Mottley said at the United Nations in September . \"Why, therefore, must the developing world now seek to find money within seven to 10 years when others had the benefit of longer tenors to repay their money?\" As an alternative, there are calls to provide more climate financing in the form of grants, which don't have to be repaid, says Gaia Larsen, director of climate finance access and deployment at the World Resources Institute's Sustainable Finance Center. \"[Hopefully], going forward, there will be means of making sure that countries are able to act on climate and that they're able to do so without further getting themselves into trouble in terms of their debt levels and their ability to pay for all the things they need to pay for,\" Larsen says. Kenyan activists at a climate protest in September demand more aid for poor countries. AP hide caption There are also problems with how money is being allocated, according to climate finance experts. Some impacts from climate change are irreversible , according to the UN, and even if countries could immediately stop emitting greenhouse gasses, the effects of global warming would still be felt for decades. Yet most of the financing that's being doled out is going to projects like wind and solar farms that are aimed at limiting further increases in global temperatures. That's left a huge shortfall for projects like building flood defenses, or introducing drought-resistant crops that can help poorer nations cope with warming that's already happened. Meanwhile, it can be \"tricky\" for the most vulnerable countries to access funding, Larsen says. The process can require data and technical expertise to show how climate funding would be used, and how it would benefit the climate, and some developing countries lack the resources for these analyses \"We cannot stop putting emphasis on mitigation, because otherwise, the adaptation costs will just skyrocket,\" says Mafalda Duarte, CEO of Climate Investment Funds , which works with multilateral development banks. But \"we have already locked in further impacts down the road,\" she says. \"And who is bearing the cost, disproportionately? It comes down to the poorest and developing countries.\" For the past year, United States President Joe Biden has been pushing to quadruple U.S. climate funding for developing countries to more than $11 billion annually starting in 2024. About half of that money needs to be appropriated by Congress. John Kerry, the United States' special presidential envoy for climate change, has suggested that the president's goal could be at risk depending on the outcome of midterm elections in the U.S. Still, Kerry says developed nations will hit their $100 billion funding target next year. \"Simply put, we developed countries need to make good on the finance goals that we have set,\" Kerry said in October at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C. But observers say those goals are just a drop in the bucket. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has said emerging economies will need at least $1 trillion a year to eliminate or offset their carbon emissions. \"[Raising] ambition in a way that is centered around real results is what I hope will come from COP,\" says Bhattacharya, \"rather than the rhetoric of the $100 billion.\"", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.774110794067383, -4.003908157348633]}, {"title": "Republicans will take back the majority this November", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/republicans-take-back-majority-november", "description": "I'm certain Republicans are going to win this November's midterm elections.", "content": "close Video Sen.

The Supreme Court this week will hear the case of a Texas family at risk of losing one of their two adopted Native American children because of a federal law they allege gives tribes \"race-based\" priority in custody disputes. The case, Haaland v. Brackeen, combines litigation from a handful of other families and multiple interested states, including Texas, where Chad and Jennifer Brackeen live with their children. The tribes defending the law, meanwhile, warn that if the Brackeens win, the case could have far-reaching consequences that undermine their sovereignty. At the center of the controversy is the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a 1970s law meant to protect Native American children in state custody proceedings. \"There are Americans out there who are eager to help these children out, and the Indian Child Welfare Act says they are not allowed to because their skin is the wrong color,\" Timothy Sandefur, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Fox News Digital.

(Tyler Olson/Fox News Digital) TEXAS FAMILY FIGHTS AT SUPREME COURT TO KEEP ADOPTED NATIVE AMERICAN CHILD DUE TO LAW THAT FAVORS TRIBES \"That's outrageous and unconstitutional,\" he said. Sandefur wrote a brief for the Goldwater institute supporting striking down ICWA. ICWA was a reaction to high rates of Native children being adopted by non-tribal members \u2013 often with little process and unjustly. It prioritizes placing Native children with extended family members, members of their tribe, and if that's not possible, with another Native family. Exceptions for \"good cause\" are allowed but not defined. Tribes argue that their children are key to their continuation as political entities and that their unique status under U.S. law means legislation directed at the tribes isn't race-based.

But Navajo Nation sought to place Y.R.J., according to the Brackeens' lawyers, \"in another state hundreds of miles away with either a great-aunt or an unrelated Navajo couple.\" That case is still in a state court in Texas. But the Brackeens' lawyers say the result of their Supreme Court case, which stemmed from their fight to keep A.L.M., will likely decide the result of Y.R.J.'s case and thus the future of their family. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CASE: JUSTICES ALITO, ROBERTS SNAP AT HARVARD LAWYER \"Our children are young, our oldest is 13, the baby sister is 4 and a half. So, to some degree, only the oldest are fully aware of what we're going through,\" Chad Brackeen told Fox News Digital. \"And it's our responsibility to sort of shield our children at this point of the uncertainty, that she could ultimately be taken, ripped from our home and moved states away.\" Another major issue Sandefur said the case could turn on is whether ICWA unconstitutionally commandeers state courts to implement federal policy. \"ICWA is the only federal law in existence that is exclusively enforced by state officials. The feds don't enforce ICWA,\" Sandefur said. \"But our federalist system under our constitution prohibits Congress from compelling states to enforce laws against their will.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch is known to be \"sensitive\" to Native American legal issues. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File) Lawyers backing top tribal leaders, however, say the consequences for Native Americans could go far beyond adoption disputes if the justices rule against them. JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN HARVARD, UNC SUPREME COURT CASES Kate Fort, the director for the Indian Law Clinic at Michigan State University, called the case a \"facial attack on tribal sovereignty.\" She also said it could \"lead to a fundamental re-understanding of how Congress can or cannot pass laws for tribes.\" Fort said other litigants suing over an alleged gambling monopoly for Native Americans in Washington state are already mimicking the arguments used in the Brackeen case. Oral arguments are scheduled for Wednesday, with an extended hearing set to last nearly two hours due to the number of parties. Unlike many politicized cases, the court may not split directly along ideological lines. Tribal law is a subject on which the justices at times may form unusual alliances to decide a case.

The Buffalo Bills aim to pad their lead atop the AFC East on Sunday when they visit the New York Jets in East Rutherford, N.J. The Bills (6-1) answered their lone loss of a season \u2014 to a divisional foe, no less \u2014 with their fourth straight win following a 27-17 victory over the Green Bay Packers last Sunday night. The Jets (5-3), in turn, saw the momentum of a four-game winning streak come to a halt with a 22-17 setback to the New England Patriots last Sunday.

Buffalo leads the NFL in passing offense (307.7 yards per game), total offense (430.6) and is second in the league in scoring (29.0). In turn, the Bills\u2019 defense ranks ninth in passing yards allowed (203.1), third in total offense (298.1) and first in points allowed (14.0). No matter how you slice it, Zach Wilson and the Jets have their work cut out for them on Sunday. To boot, New York has dropped four in a row and 12 of the last 17 meetings to Buffalo. Wilson is looking to rebound after tossing three interceptions last week. The second-year quarterback would benefit from a presence in the running game, with newcomer James Robinson (five carries, 17 yards in his Jets\u2019 debut) having an additional week to get acclimated to the system since being acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars. Allen is coming off a subpar performance \u2014 well, by his standards \u2014 in Buffalo\u2019s victory over Green Bay. Sure, he threw for two touchdowns, however he also tossed a pair of interceptions that effectively kept the Packers within earshot for longer than expected. Those picks may serve as motivation for Allen, who leads the NFL in total touchdowns (21), second in passing TDs (19), third in passing yards (2,198) and fourth among quarterbacks in rushing yards (306). Allen put up gaudy numbers in Buffalo\u2019s two-game sweep of New York last season, throwing for 605 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for 66 more yards. Expect more of the same on Sunday. Bills vs. Jets pick: Bills to cover -11.5 @ -110 at Caesars Sportsbook Allen\u2019s most trusted target is Diggs, and for good reason. Diggs leads the NFL in receiving touchdowns (seven), resides second in the league in receiving yards (764) and third in catches (55). Diggs padded those totals and silenced the talkative Jaire Alexander last week following a six-reception, 108-yard, one-touchdown performance against the Packers. The 28-year-old has found the end zone in three straight games and five of the seven the team has played. Next up for Diggs is the Jets, who the wideout has tormented by recording at least six receptions in all five career meetings. Talented New York rookie Sauce Gardner isn\u2019t expected to cover Diggs exclusively, although the latter has shown he isn\u2019t going to back down from a challenge. Bills vs. Jets pick: Stefon Diggs to record game\u2019s first touchdown @ +460 at Caesars Sportsbook The Jets\u2019 best chance to keep pace with the high-octane Bills is to establish their ground attack, thus keeping Buffalo\u2019s defense honest and, yes, keeping Allen off the field. That\u2019s obviously a tall task without star rookie running back Breece Hall, who is lost for the season due to a knee injury. Expect rough terrain for the Jets in that regard on Sunday, forcing Wilson to try his luck through the air against a Bills\u2019 defense that leads the league in interceptions with 11.

When you think of near-two-touchdown spreads in favor of the road team, you think of matchups such as Thursday night\u2019s Eagles-Texans game, when one team is 7-0 and the other is 1-5-1. Or maybe it\u2019s a situation in which the big underdog had just lost its starting quarterback. That\u2019s not the case here. Though the Bills are 6-1, the Jets are a winning team at 5-3, including 4-1 with Zach Wilson starting. So how do we get to where we are, which is now Bills -11.5 after the number dipped two points? Looking at points per game stats, the Bills\u2019 average game score is 29.0 to 14.0, a 15-point win. The Jets\u2019 average game score is 22.0 to 19.9, a 2.1-point win. The difference between those two average results is 12.9 points. Should the Jets get something for being at home? Probably not, as they are 1-3 at MetLife this season. There are better analytical ways to compare teams, but that one rudimentary measure tells me the line at least is in the correct neighborhood. The Jets have been good on defense this season, ranking sixth in yardage allowed and 11th in points allowed. Their blueprint for Sunday would be to have Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed shut down Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis, and to get physical with Josh Allen when he tries to run. The expectation here, though, is even if the defense has a good showing, the Bills are still going to score a minimum of 27 points. Risk Free First Bet up to $1,000 with NPBONUS New customers only.

So the question becomes, can the Jets even get to 16 points? Though there are quite a few things I like about their offense, that would be a tough ask against Buffalo, which ranks No. 1 in points allowed and No. 3 in yards allowed. It would become more doable if the Bills really will be without Von Miller, Matt Milano and Jordan Poyer, a star from each level of their defense. But midweek injury reports often are unreliable. Last week showed the Jets\u2019 attack is seriously diminished without Breece Hall and Alijah Vera-Tucker, and the fans will be on Wilson on Sunday if the game starts off poorly. Obviously he has to avoid the bad interceptions, but playing it safe won\u2019t put the ball in the end zone against the Bills, either. I think there are some more good days and victories ahead for the Jets after their bye, but this one has all the makings of an easy one for Buffalo. The pick: Bills -12.5. It\u2019s risky to let the injury report dictate a pick. One of the reasons I faded the Seahawks against the Giants last week was it looked as if DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett or both would miss the game. Instead, both found the end zone. The Bolts will be without WR Mike Williams, and both Keenan Allen and TE Donald Parham are questionable. It shapes up as another mess for Justin Herbert, but one of these weeks he\u2019s going to go off anyway. Kind of a heavy number to lay on the road with the Dolphins, but Tua Tagovailoa was on point in last week\u2019s win at Detroit and now faces a Bears defense that will have to reconstruct itself after the deadline trade of Roquan Smith. Though the Bengals have had some big ups and huge downs of late, this seems to be a spot where Joe Burrow can get the offense cranking again \u2014 utilizing Joe Mixon, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd in the absence of Ja\u2019Marr Chase. Another game in which I don\u2019t really know what the injury report has in store. The Lions list five offensive starters as questionable including RB D\u2019Andre Swift and C Frank Ragnow. The Packers list four questionable on offense including Aaron Rodgers and top OLs David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins. Who\u2019ll play, sit or be impaired? Who knows? I\u2019ll take the 3.5-point head start, and we\u2019ll find out. Like a lot of people, I\u2019m waiting for Josh McDaniels and Derek Carr to figure out how to win another game. Though this is a logical spot, I can see the Jaguars grinding one out in the 83-degree heat behind Travis Etienne (6.2 yards per carry). I usually get burned when I give any kind of decent number to the Colts, so I\u2019m going this way, even though Bill Belichick still appears to have some powers against young quarterbacks. The Hoodie will give Sam Ehlinger problems, but he doesn\u2019t exactly have TB12 on his side. The Commanders have won three in a row, the last one basically by miracle vs. the Colts. The Vikings, winners of five straight, are healthy offensively, and Kirk Cousins and Justin Jefferson are capable of putting up a number Tyler Heinicke can\u2019t match. Geno Smith isn\u2019t just \u201cdoing really well \u2026 for Geno Smith,\u201d he\u2019s playing well by any measure with 13 touchdown passes to just three interceptions. With RBs Kenneth Walker and Rashaad Penny cranking out a combined 5.7 yards per carry, this won\u2019t all be on Geno. Both teams have major injury questions on offense and are healthy on defense, so I\u2019m expecting a very low-scoring game here. Cooper Kupp (ankle) is trending toward playing (if you can believe what you read), and I trust Sean McVay more than Todd Bowles to come up with a winning angle. Derrick Henry rolled up 219 yards and two TDs vs. the Texans and may have been helped in a way by Malik Willis, a running threat, playing in place of Ryan Tannehill. The veteran might be back for this. Either way, I expect Henry will find some room to run vs. the Chiefs, who will be without Frank Clark and possibly Willie Gay in the front seven. If the Titans can own the clock, a cover at this number becomes more likely. Another big injury \u201cWhat If?\u201d game. Though the Saints have played competitive ball for over a month without some of their top offensive names, I wonder what the Ravens would look like if TE Mark Andrews and RB Gus Edwards have to sit it out along with WR Rashod Bateman.

This will be just the eighth time in the past 20 seasons that the two most recent Super Bowl champions will meet in the regular season. Two seasons ago, the Bucs defeated Patrick Mahomes\u2019 Chiefs to win Super Bowl LV. Quarterback Tom Brady earned his seventh Super Bowl title and fifth MVP award, both the most by any player ever. Last season, the Rams took down Joe Burrow\u2019s Bengals to win Super Bowl LVI. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp was awarded MVP for his game-winning touchdown and head coach Sean McVay made history as the youngest head coach to ever win a Super Bowl. But before they made it to the main stage, Los Angeles conquered Tampa Bay in the divisional round. This week\u2019s matchup will be the first time the teams have met since then. With both the Bucs and Rams posting losing records, this season presents entirely different circumstances. The Buccaneers have lost three games in a row, for Brady\u2019s worst-ever start to a season. The Rams, with last week\u2019s loss to the San Francisco 49ers, have lost both of their divisional matchups this season. What has caused these two teams to struggle? Tampa Bay has been plagued with injuries since the start of the season. Most recently, starting linebacker Shaq Barrett suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. However, they could be welcoming back some key players in the coming weeks. The team did not make any moves before the trade deadline, leaving the assumption that they believe the current roster is competent for the remainder of the season. The Rams\u2019 biggest struggle has been on offense. They rank 28th in the league when they have had to convert third downs of six or longer yards. To compare, they ranked third in that category last season. They have trouble running the ball, as shown in last week\u2019s loss to the 49ers. During that game, just 56 of 223 yards of total offense gained came on the ground. For either team, a win this week would provide momentum heading into the second half of the season. With both teams majorly struggling on offense, this game could be a low-scoring affair in which capitalizing on opposing mistakes is the main difference between success and failure. Tune in on Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET to see which team emerges victorious. Week 9 also features a divisional matchup between the Buffalo Bills (6-1) and New York Jets (5-3). The AFC East is one of the league\u2019s most competitive divisions, and one of two divisions (NFC East) in which all four teams have won at least four games. Buffalo enters the matchup on a four-game win streak and heavily favored against their opponent. The game presents an interesting comparison between quarterbacks Josh Allen and Zach Wilson. After undefeated start to season, how did the Philadelphia Eagles become Super Bowl contenders? In his fifth year, Allen is having one of the best seasons of his career. He is consistently in the conversation alongside names like Mahomes and Brady regarding the league\u2019s best signal-callers. Through seven games, his 2,504 combined passing and rushing yards trail only Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning and Drew Brees for the most such combined yards by a quarterback in his first seven games of a season. Wilson, on the other hand, has struggled at the start of his second year. His passer rating is 34th among quarterbacks who have started at least three games, and his completion percentage is tied for 35th. The interesting part is that Wilson\u2019s recent performance is reminiscent of Allen\u2019s at the same point in his career. For example, Wilson threw three interceptions in the Jet\u2019s Week 8 loss to the Patriots. Allen had a nearly identical experience, throwing three interceptions and making many other mental mistakes during a Bills\u2019 loss to the Patriots back in 2019. Allen is a shining example that not all great quarterbacks come out of the gate great; some take longer than others to sink into their role and reach their highest potential. The rest of the season will be an indicator of whether or not Wilson is able to replicate a similar rise to eminence. Through eight games, Wilson\u2019s glimmers of greatness have been overshadowed by mistakes and inexperience. In a highly competitive AFC East, Wilson has the second-half of the season to prove whether or not he has the ability to be the Jets\u2019 next franchise quarterback. To see Wilson and Allen in action, tune in on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes has the chance to make history on Sunday when the Chiefs (5-2) host the Tennessee Titans (5-2). The QB has recorded a league-leading 20 touchdown passes this season and ranks fourth with 2,159 passing yards. Through 70 career games (all starts), Mahomes has totaled 21,150 passing yards and 171 touchdown passes. With 105 passing yards against the Titans, Mahomes would surpass Matthew Stafford for the most passing yards ever by a quarterback in his first 75 career starts. With three touchdown passes, Mahomes will surpass Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino for the most-ever by a quarterback in his first 75 career starts. The Titans enter the matchup first in their division and on a five-game win streak. Out of the last ten meetings with Kansas City, Tennessee has won eight. Kickoff is set for Sunday Night at 8:25 p.m. ET. Here\u2019s how to catch these teams and others across the league in action, from wherever you are.

George Frey/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Early voting ballots move through a ballot and signature verification machine at the Utah County election offices in Provo, Utah, on Friday. As Election Day approaches and the rhetoric and vitriol increase, it's useful to remember the wise and immortal words of Smokey the Bear: \"Only you can prevent wildfires.\" That's because anyone who's online and shares information plays some role in shaping whether falsehoods gain traction. Now you may ask, \"But I'm just one person \u2014 what about Twitter? What about Facebook? And what about politicians with huge followings who spread falsehoods and misleading claims all the time?\" It's true that our society and many others around the world are facing what some researchers call \"truth decay.\" Bad actors can and do game social and traditional media in order to flood the zone with conspiracy theories that sometimes promote violent and extremist agendas . But in the past decade or so, the way people consume information has radically changed thanks to social media. And you, the user, have some influence over the algorithms that serve you posts, videos and news stories in your feed. With that in mind, here are several things to consider when sharing news of all kinds, but especially election news. This is probably the most important one. How does the person posting about this story know what is happening? Is it an election official explaining the process? Is it a reporter from a trusted news organization who's on the ground? Is it an account or a news outlet you've never heard of before? Here's a quiz from the nonprofit News Literacy Project you can take to help evaluate if a news source is credible. Relying on local election officials and local journalists who understand the ins and outs of how people in your community vote will generally yield better-quality information than, say, random Twitter accounts with large followings. Election officials are particularly important for helping explain changing voting procedures and how ballots are collected and counted, as opposed to political candidates, who may try to spin or exaggerate what is happening. If you see a piece of news circulating that seems surprising or off in some way, it's worth checking to see if other news outlets are reporting the same thing. Are they confirming the news themselves or merely attributing it to another source? Is the source that's being attributed credible? Elections in the United States are incredibly decentralized. It's both a strength and weakness of our democracy. Election rules and procedures vary state by state and sometimes even county by county. Some states allow mail-in ballots received before Election Day to be processed, sometimes even counted, in advance. Others leave the processing and counting of mail-in ballots until after the polls close . Local election officials have been explaining their counting process in advance and trying to set voters' expectations around the pace with which results will come out.

With Republicans increasingly focused on voting in-person on Election Day, while many Democrats vote early or by mail, the results could swing from one party to the other depending on the batch of ballots that has been tabulated. It's not a sign that the results have been tampered with, merely an indication that the ways people vote has become polarized and with it, the way the results come in. Many voters watch election night coverage on TV and get the impression that the TV networks have some role in determining the outcome when they make race calls. That's not true. What the networks are actually doing is making projections about the winner based on the public vote counts released by local and state election officials. State election officials are the only ones who officially declare a winner in a process that can take days or weeks after Election Day. NPR relies on The Associated Press for its vote count data and uses that organization's race calls. The AP says it makes a call only when it \"is fully confident a race has been won \u2014 defined most simply as the moment a trailing candidate no longer has a path to victory.\" You could see photos and videos alleging nefarious behavior or a gross injustice. Look for a difference between what the post says you're seeing and what the video or photo actually shows. Often, a photo or video is grainy, magnified or altogether not clear. Sometimes a reverse image search will reveal that the picture is years old or from another country! In many cases, there's no evidence in the post or allegation to support the premise that someone is, for example, casting a ballot illegally, mishandling a ballot or being denied the right to vote. In fact, a recent documentary-style film that alleged widespread fraud during 2020 used still images of a man casting a ballot in a Georgia drop box to claim the man was voting illegally. In fact, the man was voting legally and is suing the filmmakers for defamation . The 2020 election was the most-scrutinized election in U.S. history. There were dozens of federal and state lawsuits challenging various aspects of how the election was conducted and in some instances, asserting organized election fraud. None of those claims was corroborated. None of the suits led to changes in the outcome of the election. Most cases of ballot and election fraud tend to involve an extremely small number of ballots and are quickly identified. The most significant case of election fraud in the past 40 years took place in Bladen County, N.C., in 2018 when the state refused to certify the results of a U.S. House race after investigators revealed that a political operative working for the Republican candidate had mishandled a significant number of absentee ballots he had collected. The results of that contest were called into question within weeks of Election Day . Even the broadest database of election fraud cases collected by the conservative Heritage Foundation shows about 750 cases of documented voter fraud involving approximately 1,100 people over 40 years and billions of ballots cast. Many election researchers take issue with the organization's methodology , which they view as overly expansive.

But in today's environment, a mistake of any kind can become fodder for a conspiratorial narrative . It's OK to react emotionally to the news! There are a lot of things happening in the world that many people find upsetting. But in our highly polarized society, many actors try to capitalize on tribal political identities.

What did was the fact that the same weekend there were 10 people killed and 62 people wounded by gunfire in Chicago\u2026 and no one seemed to care. I decided to do some research and the findings were staggering. Through the end of August 2022, 2,352 people had been shot in Chicago, 448 fatally. In 2021 there were 797 homicides in Chicago and 3,561 shootings, per the Chicago Police Department. Chicago had a homicide rate of 28.6 for every 100,000 people, significantly above the national homicide rate of 6.5 murders per 100,000. And again, no one seems to care. And it isn\u2019t just crime.

Farah Yousry/Side Effects Public Media hide caption Susie Talevski has gone through years of legal back-and-forth with the state agency in Indiana that operates the nursing home where her father, Gorgi, resided before his death. When Susie Talevski sued the agency that managed her elderly father's care before he died, she hoped to get justice for her family. She did not expect the case would grow into a national bellwether. A ruling against her could strip millions of vulnerable Americans of their power to hold states accountable when they do not receive benefits allowed by law. \"This case has taken on, really, a life of its own way beyond what I could have foreseen,\" said Talevski, a resident of Valparaiso, Ind. Talevski filed a lawsuit in 2019 alleging that her father's rights were violated at a nursing home where he resided to get 24/7 care for his dementia. \"He went from being able to walk and talk ... to not being able to move,\" Talevski said. \"[The nursing facility] treated my dad like trash, like a dog. In fact, dogs are treated better than that.\" In court filings, the Talevski family claims that her father was overmedicated to keep him asleep, his dementia wasn't properly managed, and he was involuntarily transferred to different facilities hours away from the family's home, which accelerated his decline. Gorgi Talevski died a year ago, in October. Talevski sued the Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion County, the public health agency in Indiana that owns the nursing facility. The agency declined to comment on the case. In court documents, it argued that Gorgi Talevski was violent and sexually aggressive and that affected his care. HHC tried to get the case dismissed, saying Talevski didn't have the right to sue. But federal courts said the lawsuit could move forward. So, the public health agency made an unexpected move. It took the case to the nation's highest court and posed a sweeping question: Should people who depend on initiatives that are funded in part by the federal government \u2014 such as Medicaid and programs that provide services for nutrition, housing and disabilities \u2014 be allowed to sue states when their rights are violated? A ruling in favor of the Marion county Health and Hospital Corp. could mean millions of Americans who rely on federal assistance programs would lose that right. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Tuesday \u2014 Nov. 8. \"The reach of an adverse decision would be catastrophic,\" said Jane Perkins , an attorney at the National Health Law Program. \"It would leave these programs really standing out there without a true enforcement mechanism.\" HHC of Marion County owns and operates 78 skilled nursing facilities across the state of Indiana in a public-private partnership with American Senior Communities. The answer to the question of whether people who depend on federal assistance programs can sue if their rights are violated has been settled precedent for decades, said Perkins, who has litigated numerous civil rights cases for Medicaid beneficiaries over the years. For that reason, she was shocked when she learned the Supreme Court had chosen to hear this case. The Supreme Court is asked to review nearly 7,000 cases each year and they often agree to look at only 1 to 2 % of them. Perkins said she sees parallels between this case and the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. \"The idea that the court would accept this case and accept that question of whether you can ever enforce these laws is of concern,\" Perkins said. \"The recent court decisions \u2014 Dobbs in the abortion context coming to mind \u2014 shows the court is willing to set aside precedent.\" Since the Supreme Court agreed to look at the case, 25 entities filed amicus briefs , which provide courts information from people not directly involved in a case. Most of them sided with the Talevskis \u2014 including current members of Congress like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Whip James Clyburn, AARP , American Cancer Network , American Public Health Association , and Children's Health Care Providers and Advocates . Marion County will be represented by Lawrence S. Robbins , who has argued 19 cases before the Supreme Court and represented Christine Blasey Ford during the confirmation hearing of Justice Brett Kavanagh. Talevski will be represented by Andrew Timothy Tutt of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer. Recently, Tutt has argued and won a case before the Supreme Court that safeguarded the reemployment rights of thousands of veterans and servicemembers. Programs like Medicaid that rely on federal money flowing from Congress to states typically come with a set of provisions or requirements that states are supposed to follow in order to receive and use this money. Civil rights lawsuits are one of the primary enforcement mechanisms beneficiaries of those programs have to hold state agencies accountable if the agencies violate their rights or fail to provide entitled services. There are other means of oversight, which supporters of the Indiana state agency's petition tout as viable alternatives to lawsuits. One of those alternative enforcement mechanisms, for example, is federal oversight by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency can investigate and threaten to withhold funding from state programs that fail to comply with federal provisions. But this usually involves lengthy legal processes that can be counterproductive, stalling benefits to individual patients, instead of helping them. \"If [HHS] tries to turn off the money, the state could take them to court immediately and get an injunction,\" arguing that the ceasing of federal funds would cause irreparable harm, said Sara Rosenbaum , professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. \"People [would be] left totally without their benefits, or the providers are left totally without their payments.\" Former senior HHS officials say that federal oversight is far from sufficient and that civil rights lawsuits remain a crucial enforcement mechanism. Private enforcement through lawsuits is indispensable for nursing home residents, they say, especially in places like Indiana where the state owns the vast majority of nursing homes. The former officials said in a court brief that a decision in favor of Marion County would potentially raise the risk of waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid funds, leading to widespread underenforcement and leaving \"millions of individuals, providers, and other beneficiaries more vulnerable to violations of their statutory rights.\" Nearly 83 million Americans , a quarter of the U.S. population, are enrolled in Medicaid. This means HHS oversees more than half a trillion dollars in spending across 56 states and territories \u2014 and the federal agency, the former officials argue, lacks the logistical and practical capacity to \"meaningfully remedy individual violations in many cases.\" Indiana's Attorney General Todd Rokita is among allies publicly supporting the state's perspective. Rokita, in a court brief filed along with 21 other Republican attorneys general, said civil rights lawsuits burden states and cripple them with legal expenses, just to line the pockets of attorneys rather than benefit Medicaid enrollees. \"The state has litigated 1,200 civil rights cases just in the last three years,\" Rokita said in a written statement. Legal experts told Side Effects that the number Rokita cites is highly misleading because it lumps together all civil rights lawsuits, not just those that have to do with federal entitlement programs, which are at the heart of this case. For example, civil rights lawsuits can be filed by people who are wrongly denied a permit to protest, alleging the state violated their right to freedom of expression, or by people who are subjected to excessive use of force by police, or denied medical treatment while in prison. The right to file those kinds of lawsuits will not be affected by the outcome of this case. Chris Schandevel , an attorney at the legal nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, which sides with the state of Indiana in this case, said cases like Susie Talevski's infringe on states' autonomy, and give the power to dictate what's best for states and their beneficiaries to unelected federal judges. This case is not about taking away people's rights, Schandevel and some nursing home associations and other state officials argue. It's about a contract between two parties, the federal government and the states, that a third party \u2014 beneficiaries of public programs \u2014 want to meddle with. Schandevel gives a hypothetical example of a contract between himself, as an investor, and a construction company to build a shopping mall in one neighborhood. A lawsuit like the Talevski case would be akin to a neighbor suing the construction company because the shopping mall \"is not being built fast enough.\" \"Should that third party be able to file a lawsuit in federal court against me and say that I'm not holding up my end of the deal in the contract? We would say that basic fairness says no,\" Schandevel said. \"And the same should apply for contracts between the federal government and states, too.\" But advocates and public policy experts say Schandevel's analogy is not sound. What he describes as a contract between the state and the federal government is more of a \"treaty\" to serve that third party \u2014 the beneficiaries of entitlement programs. Plus, they point out, what's at stake is not a shopping mall. It's the health and well-being of the nation's most vulnerable residents. A few years ago, Sarah Jackson , a mother of six in Fort Wayne, Ind., who had hepatitis C, couldn't get access to the medication that doctors said she needed. Jackson was on Medicaid, and recovering from a substance use disorder. Indiana was among several states that severely restricted which Medicaid patients qualified for this drug, because of its high cost \u2014 despite medical opinions saying this treatment should be standard of care for most hepatitis C patients. Jackson was desperate for the hepatitis C medication. She sought help from the ACLU of Indiana, and attorney Gavin Rose took her case. Rose filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Jackson and other Medicaid recipients in her situation. \"There was a significant outbreak in Southern Indiana at the time and we ultimately ended up with a settlement that said Indiana is going to start providing [coverage] consistent with what every doctor says they should be doing,\" said Rose, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Indiana. The lawsuit resulted in Jackson and thousands of others gaining access to the life-altering treatment. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Health and Hospital Corporation, these lawsuits may not be possible in the future, said Emily Munson , an attorney with the advocacy group Indiana Disability Rights . Emily Munson, an attorney with Indiana Disability Rights, says the premise of the Supreme Court case Health and Hospital Corp. v. Talevski scares her. She filed an amicus brief in support of the Talevskis, outlining the importance of lawsuits in enforcing rights for vulnerable populations. Farah Yousry/Side Effects Public Media hide caption Emily Munson, an attorney with Indiana Disability Rights, says the premise of the Supreme Court case Health and Hospital Corp. v. Talevski scares her. She filed an amicus brief in support of the Talevskis, outlining the importance of lawsuits in enforcing rights for vulnerable populations. When states tried to cap the benefits of people with disabilities in Indiana and across the nation, civil rights lawsuits have helped these patients gain access to things like in-home support with day-to-day tasks, known as attendant care. Munson has litigated similar cases. She has a disability herself, and the prospect of a Supreme Court decision in favor of Marion County terrifies her. \"I rely on Medicaid for attendant care, for wheelchair repairs,\" Munson said, \"and losing the ability to go to federal court if need be is very scary, because the administrative procedures that folks like Attorney General Rokita say we can rely on are not effective.\" During the latest monthly Health and Hospital Corp. board of trustees meeting in mid-October , the monumental case was absent from the agenda. But when the meeting opened for public comment, state representatives, patients and advocates seized the opportunity to voice their concerns. They had one demand for the agency: withdraw its Supreme Court petition. Michael Oles, national field director of the advocacy organization Our Revolution, made it clear at last month's board meeting of the Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion County, Ind., that he supports the Talevskis, and their right to sue the nursing home that they say mistreated their late father.

State Representatives like Robin Shackleford, a Democrat from Indianapolis, have been vocal about their concerns. Shackleford said many of her constituents are on Medicaid and SNAP , the USDA's supplemental nutrition program. \"They would be horrified ... if they knew the board was the driver behind removing their rights,\" Shackleford said. But even if the agency complies with the demands and withdraws its petition, legal experts say it might be too late. Now that the Supreme Court has shown interest in looking at such a sweeping question, there's a good chance it could pick up the next case that raises it.

The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) defeated the Philadelphia Union to clinch the organization\u2019s first MLS Cup and part-owner Will Ferrell was there to witness it all. After the game, Ferrell did not shy away from joining the celebrations. The 55-year-old actor was seen surrounded by a crowd drinking champagne from the trophy. After his drink, Ferrell was still hungry and decided to take a bite out of MLS Cup hero Gareth Bale\u2019s medal . Bale scored the match-tying goal in the 128th minute. The California native became a partner with the club in January 2016 when he joined a venture of over 25 others including soccer legend Mia Hamm and her MLB star husband Nomar Garciaparra. Among the 29 owners of LAFC is NBA legend Magic Johnson, who earned himself yet another addition to his trophy shelf with the win. The Basketball Hall of Famer has previously won 10 championships with the LA Lakers, 5 each as a player and an owner. He also added rings from other leagues following the Dodgers\u2019 World Series title in 2020 and the LA Sparks\u2019 WNBA championship in 2016. After LAFC clinched the title on penalty kicks, Johnson congratulated the team and his co-owners on a successful season. \u201cI want to share with the world, Cookie and I are champions again!!

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (AP) Sources in former President Donald Trump\u2019s political orbit tell Fox News that a potential 2024 announcement could possibly occur during the week starting on Monday, Nov. 14 \u2014 just a week after the midterms. But the sources caution that things are \"fluid.\" Axios on Friday reported that Trump and his political team are eyeing Nov. 14 as a possible launch date for a potential 2024 presidential campaign , which would be followed by a string of political events. A source in Trump's political orbit waved Fox News off the actual date of Nov. 14 but added \"that week is being looked at, but it\u2019s all fluid.\" Kochel, a veteran of numerous presidential campaigns, said that if the latest reporting on the former president comes to fruition, \"Trump is going to push his chips on the table within a week or two after the midterms and then we\u2019re off to the races.\" IT'S ALL ABOUT LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION, AS TRUMP RETURNS TO IOWA Trump has been constantly flirting with making another presidential run since leaving the White House in January 2021. At rallies across the nation in support of his endorsed GOP candidates in recent months, Trump has discussed the potential for a 2024 run and has repeatedly said, \"I may have to do it again.\"The former president has also repeatedly made unproven claims that his 2020 election loss to now- President Biden was due to \"massive voter fraud.\" Former President Donald Trump reacts to a supporter during a rally, Thursday, Nov. 3, 2022, in Sioux City, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) The former president amped up his 2024 language during a rally Thursday in Iowa, the state whose caucuses for half a century have kicked off the presidential nominating calendar. \"I will very, very, very probably do it again, OK? Very, very, very probably,\" Trump said at the rally in Sioux City, located in the deep red northwestern corner of Iowa . \"Get ready. That\u2019s all I\u2019m telling you. Very soon. Get ready. Get ready.\" Nearly two years after his re-election defeat, Trump remains hands-down the most popular and influential politician in the Republican Party, and the most ferocious fundraiser who holds sway over grassroots donors. And poll after poll indicates that Trump would start out as the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP nomination. WARNING SHOT FROM TRUMP TO POTENTIAL GOP 2024 RIVALS However, Trump's standing in the GOP and repeated 2024 teasing hasn't kept other potential Republican White House hopefuls from making moves toward launching presidential campaigns. Former Vice President Mike Pence; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley; Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas; and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are among the possible White House hopefuls who have made multiple trips to Iowa and the other early-voting primary and caucus states over the past year and a half. Former Vice President Mike Pence headlines the annual Kaufmann Family Harvest Dinner, on Sept. 29, 2022 in Wilton, Iowa. (AP ) Besides a potential Trump announcement, the week after the midterms will also see the first real Republican 2024 cattle calls. Up first is the Republican Governors Association\u2019s annual winter meeting, which is being held this year near Orlando, Florida. Among those attending who have said they\u2019re mulling a White House bid or who are viewed by political prognosticators as potential contenders are Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Larry Hogan of Maryland, and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, as well as Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. GET READY FOR THE FIRST MAJOR 204 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CATTLE CALL At the end of the week, as first reported by Fox News late last month, a dozen GOP politicians whom pundits view as potential or likely contenders for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, will attend the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s (RJC) annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas. The twelve are Pence, Pompeo, Haley, Cotton, Cruz, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, DeSantis, Hogan, Sununu, and former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (James Gilbert/Getty Images) Pointing to Trump, Kochel noted that \"he\u2019s clearly the heavyweight. He\u2019s the big foot in the field.\" But he added that the former president \"is not going to clear the field. He\u2019s going to accelerate people\u2019s timelines for deciding whether they go or not go. I think you\u2019ll have some people who say they won\u2019t run because Trump\u2019s in. He\u2019s going to have one or more serious challengers who are going to make a run at him.\" And Kochel said \"I would imagine by the end of the first quarter of 2023 we\u2019ll probably know who\u2019s really going to get in.\" Rath, also a veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, predicted that \"I think there\u2019s going to be somebody who we\u2019re not looking at now who emerges because there\u2019s an opportunity. They have a window of three to six months to make that decision.\" When 2022 collides with 2024 in NH New Hampshire is a key general election battleground state with crucial Senate race between former governor and first-term Dem. Sen. Maggie Hassan and GOP nominee and former general Don Bolduc that\u2019s one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the chamber\u2019s majority. And the state\u2019s two congressional districts are considered competitive \u2014 especially the very swingy First District \u2014 and the winners in both those races will impact whether the Democrats are able to hold onto their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. But New Hampshire is also the state that for a century\u2019s held the first presidential primary in the White House race, and the Granite State\u2019s seen plenty of traffic this cycle by out-of-state politicians who may harbor national ambitions in the 2024 election cycle. That traffic has intensified in recent days. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (Fox News ) Haley returns to New Hampshire on Sunday to campaign with Bolduc. It\u2019s Haley\u2019s third trip to the Granite State in the past six weeks to team up with her party\u2019s U.S. Senate nominee in New Hampshire. On Wednesday, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder trekked to New Hampshire to team up on the campaign trail with GOP congressional nominee Karoline Leavitt, who\u2019s challenging Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in the First District. Elder, who was the top GOP vote getter in last year\u2019s unsuccessful gubernatorial recall election in California, says he\u2019s mulling a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and promised plenty of return trips to New Hampshire and Iowa, where he also recently stopped. While he wasn\u2019t in New Hampshire in person, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom pundits view as a possible Republican presidential hopeful, endorsed Bolduc this past week and put his name on a fundraising email for the Senate nominee. Ditto for Sen. Tim Scott, who endorsed Bolduc and whose aligned PAC spent six-figures to boost the GOP Senate nominee. And Sen Rick Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, stopped in New Hampshire last weekend to team up with Bolduc. As for the Democrats, Hassan is getting some high profile help this weekend from three Democrats who ran for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination and may possibly run again in 2024 if President Biden decides against seeking a second term. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive champion, made the short trip on Friday from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to campaign with Hassan at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. And U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota \u2014 who came in second and third in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire \u2014 join Hassan on the Granite State campaign trail on Sunday. Hogan trolling Biden President Biden will be in Maryland on the eve of the election, headlining a Democratic National Committee rally in Columbia, Maryland. Larry Hogan, the term-limited Republican governor of the heavily blue state, plans to bracket Biden\u2019s visit with a video spotlighting the governor\u2019s achievements and criticizing Biden\u2019s presidency.

Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season started with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Houston Texans on Thursday night and will end with a Monday night battle between the Baltimore Ravens and New Orleans Saints. With the season nearly halfway through, there are several games Sunday that may have playoff implications, making for a great day of football. The Kansas City Chiefs are back in action while a rematch of an NFC Divisional Round playoff game is also taking place. Teams rising and falling in their respective divisions are also at a critical point in their seasons and need to come up with a victory. Read below to see how Sunday will go. -- Falcons (4-4) vs. Chargers (4-3) \u2013 1 p.m. ET, FOX Falcons quarterback Marcus Mariota throws as Carolina Panthers defensive end Brian Burns defends, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Amis) The Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Chargers enter Week 9 in a pivotal game for both teams. The Falcons are leading the NFC North, which is tightly packed. The Chargers are a game behind the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West. Atlanta might have Cordarrelle Patterson back for the game while the Chargers are likely to be without Mike Williams and Keenan Allen. The Falcons got a huge boost in an overtime win over the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles is coming back from a bye week. The winner of this game will get momentum going forward at such a crucial point of the season. Playoff berths may hang in the balance. Jets (5-3) vs. Bills (6-1) \u2013 1 p.m. ET, CBS New England Patriots wide receiver Jakobi Meyers crosses the goal line to score against New York Jets, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) The AFC East may not feel like it\u2019s close but the standings, for now, tell a different story. The Buffalo Bills are the best team in the conference moving into Week 9 and would be the best team in the NFL if it weren\u2019t for the Eagles. Josh Allen is looking for the fourth straight week with two or more touchdown passes. He has 325 or more passing yards in two of the last three games. Allen will have a chance to pick on rookie Sauce Gardner, who has been fantastic for the Jets in his first season. He has 12 passes defended in seven of the last eight games and 12 total this season. He\u2019ll have his work cut out for him trying to guard Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis or Dawson Knox. A New York win would be a real shocker. Buffalo has won the last four games. Commanders (4-4) vs. Vikings (6-1) \u2013 1 p.m. ET, FOX Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin makes a catch over Colts cornerback Stephon Gilmore in Indianapolis, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. (AP Photo/AJ Mast) Don\u2019t look now, but the Washington Commanders are riding a three-game winning streak as they welcome the Minnesota Vikings. The team narrowly escaped the Indianapolis Colts last week. In a tight NFC East, every game matters from here on out for the Commanders and riding the wave with Taylor Heinicke, Terry McLaurin and the combination of Antonio Gibson and Brian Robinson Jr. might just be what the team needed to get in motion. On the other side, Kirk Cousins has the Vikings ahead in the NFC North. But they cannot afford to take their foot off the gas. The Green Bay Packers could strike at any moment and if the Vikings fall asleep just for a week or two they could be looking at a streaking Aaron Rodgers. Justin Jefferson and Dalvin Cook will be just as important as ever in this one. Buccaneers (3-5) vs. Rams (3-4) \u2013 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald celebrates after a sack against the San Francisco 49ers Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022, in Inglewood, California. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Ten months ago, these two teams were battling in the playoffs and now sit on the outside looking in through eight weeks. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have sputtered offensively. Tom Brady looks like a shell of himself and the rest of the offense cannot seem to get it in gear for long enough to put points on the board. A long layoff from last week's Thursday night loss to the Baltimore Ravens might help them. But injuries on the offensive line and to Shaq Barrett definitely don\u2019t help their circumstances. The Los Angeles Rams have been up and down and battling injuries as well. But to stay relevant in the NFC West, a win will be needed against the Buccaneers on Sunday. Los Angeles is ranked 28th in points scored and 30th in yards gained. Something will have to give. Chiefs (5-2) vs. Titans (5-2) \u2013 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and wide receiver Mecole Hardman celebrate a touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez) Sunday night\u2019s big game will be between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tennessee Titans. The Chiefs and Titans are both division leaders and fans will get a treat with a dynamo offense led by Patrick Mahomes and one of the biggest running backs in the game in Derrick Henry. To say Mahomes is on fire entering Week 9 is an understatement. He has 33 career games with 300 or more passing yards in six seasons. It\u2019s the most all-time of any quarterback in that span. Tennessee only has allowed 19.7 points per game and the defense will need to step up big time. So will Kansas City. Henry rushed for a season-high 219 yards last game and is looking for his sixth game in a row with 130 or more scrimmage yards and fifth straight same with 100 or more rushing yards. -- How Sunday shakes out 1 p.m. ET: Bears (3-5) vs. Chargers (5-3) 1 p.m. ET: Bengals (4-4) vs. Panthers (2-6) 1 p.m. ET: Lions (1-6) vs. Packers (3-5) 1 p.m. ET: Patriots (4-4) vs. Colts (3-4-1) 1 p.m. ET: Jaguars (2-6) vs. Raiders (2-5) 4:05 p.m. ET: Cardinals (3-5) vs. Seahawks (5-3) Ryan Gaydos is the sports editor for Fox News Digital.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "foxnews", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-23.212833404541016, -8.177864074707031]}, {"title": "Packers vs. Lions predictions: Week 9 NFL picks, odds and betting offers", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/packers-vs-lions-predictions-week-9-nfl-picks-odds-and-betting-offers/", "description": "The Packers are 3-5 and looking to bounce back against the Lions who sit at 1-6 with significant struggles on defense.", "content": "Get the free Action Network app for expert picks, live odds, bet tracking and more.

The NFC continues to offer a roadmap to a potential wildcard spot but the Minnesota Vikings (6-1) are threatening to run away with the division. Detroit is not looking like a threat to that crown at all with a 1-6 record and one of the worst defenses statistically through eight weeks. Beating Green Bay is always a feel-good moment for the Lions. The Lions defeated the Packers 37-30 in Detroit last season, snapping Green Bay\u2019s five-game winning streak in the series. With pass protection, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has looked like him self through the growing pains of breaking in a reliable receiver or three. And he\u2019s found a career worth of glimmering success against the Lions. The Lions also have to tighten up a defense that allowed 382 passing yards to Tua Tagovailoa last week and in Week 7 Detroit was railroaded by the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 ground game. It\u2019s all good news for Rodgers and a team that needs a get-well type of Sunday. Even in a season being framed as a down year for Rodgers, he has two TD passes in six of his past seven starts. Packers vs. Lions prediction: Aaron Rodgers over 1.5 TD passes @ -130 ( Caesars Sportsbook ) Aaron Jones has been the focus of almost every defense the Packers have seen this season and the Week 9 meeting with the Lions is not the exception. But Jones has worn a target in this rivalry before, and the results favor No. 33. Jones had 115 total yards (67 rushing, 48 receiving) with four TDs (three rec., one rush) in his last game vs the Lions. He\u2019s also coming off of a season-high production total: 157 total yards, including 143 rushing. Detroit ranks 29th in total defense and is one of the eight worst teams in tackling per Pro Football Focus. Jones runs wild. Packers vs. Lions prediction: Aaron Jones over 96.5 total yards @ -135 ( Caesars Sportsbook ) The Lions allow 32.1 points per game and the Packers surrender 21.6 per game, and neither team has been great out of the gate at slowing their opponents. Detroit has allowed 49 points in the first quarter this season. Green Bay has been outscored 33-27 in the first quarter this season. Each team scored a touchdown in the first quarter of both meetings last season (7-7), and the 2020 games featured 17 points (14-3, Lions) and 14 points (7-7).

John Fetterman, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022, in Philadelphia. LATROBE, Pa. \u2014 Former President Donald Trump is predicting America's destruction if his fellow Republicans don't deliver a massive electoral wave on Tuesday. Democrats, led by President Joe Biden and two other former presidents, are warning that abortion rights, Social Security and even democracy itself are at stake. Three of the six living presidents delivered dire closing messages Saturday in battleground Pennsylvania entering the final weekend of the 2022 midterm elections, but their words echoed across the country as millions of Americans cast ballots to decide the balance of power in Washington and in key state capitals. Polls across America will close on Tuesday, but more than 39 million people have already voted. On Sunday, Biden was set to campaign in suburban New York, while Trump was headed to Florida. \"If you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then on Tuesday you must vote Republican in a giant red wave,\" Trump told thousands of cheering supporters as he campaigned Saturday in western Pennsylvania, describing the United States as \"a country in decline.\" Earlier in the day, Biden shared the stage with former President Barack Obama in Philadelphia, the former running mates campaigning together for the first time since Biden took office. In neighboring New York, even former President Bill Clinton, largely absent from national politics in recent years, was out defending his party. \"Sulking and moping is not an option,\" Obama charged. \"On Tuesday, let's make sure our country doesn't get set back 50 years.\" Not everyone, it seemed, was on message as the weekend began. Even before arriving in Pennsylvania, Biden was dealing with a fresh political mess after upsetting some in his party for promoting plans to shut down fossil fuel plants in favor of green energy. While he made the comments in California the day before, the fossil fuel industry is a major employer in Pennsylvania. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the president owed coal workers across the country an apology. He called Biden's comments \"offensive and disgusting.\" Former President Donald Trump applauds toward the crowd at the conclusion of an election rally in Latrobe, Pa., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022. Jacqueline Larma/AP hide caption Former President Donald Trump applauds toward the crowd at the conclusion of an election rally in Latrobe, Pa., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022. Trump seized on the riff in western Pennsylvania, charging that Biden \"has resumed the war on coal, your coal.\" The White House said Biden's words were \"twisted to suggest a meaning that was not intended; he regrets it if anyone hearing these remarks took offense\" and that he was \"commenting on a fact of economics and technology.\" Democrats are deeply concerned about their narrow majorities in the House and Senate as voters sour on Biden's leadership amid surging inflation, crime concerns and widespread pessimism about the direction of the country. History suggests that Democrats, as the party in power, will suffer significant losses in the midterms. Trump peeked ahead toward Florida as he campaigned in Pennsylvania, slapping at the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. After displaying recent presidential poll numbers on the big screens, Trump called DeSantis, a potential 2024 GOP rival, \"Ron DeSanctimonious.\" Trump's weekend travels were part of a late blitz that will also take him to Ohio. He's hoping a strong GOP showing on Tuesday will generate momentum for the 2024 run that he's expected to launch in the days or weeks after polls close. Over and over on Saturday, Trump falsely claimed he lost the 2020 election only because Democrats cheated, while raising the possibility of election fraud this coming week. In part, because of such rhetoric, federal intelligence agencies have warned of the possibility of political violence from far-right extremists in the coming days. \"Everybody, I promise you, in the very next \u2014 very, very, very short period of time, you're going to be happy,\" Trump said of another White House bid. \"But first we have to win an historic victory for Republicans on Nov. 8.\" Biden's Pennsylvania address was largely the same he has been giving for weeks \u2014 spotlighting a grab bag of his major legislative achievements, while warning that abortion rights, voting rights, Social Security and Medicare are at risk should Republicans take control of Congress. The president highlighted the Inflation Reduction Action, passed in August by the Democratic-led Congress, which includes several health care provisions popular among older adults and the less well-off, including a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket medical expenses and a $35 monthly cap per prescription on insulin.

With center Mitchell Robinson out for at least a week with a sprained knee , coach Tom Thibodeau went back to an undersized frontcourt of Randle and Toppin for a few brief stretches Saturday night. But it was much less effective than the night before as the Knicks fell to the Celtics, 133-118, at the Garden. \u201cSome good,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cObviously the pace of the game is much faster, so that\u2019s a big plus. I want to see the film. I just didn\u2019t think our defense with any group was what it needed to be. But I do like it.

The Knicks went from down 12 to a two-point win. But on Saturday, even with the Celtics missing big men Al Horford and Robert Williams, the Randle-Toppin duo could not take advantage and find the same magic as the Knicks were minus-15 in seven minutes with them on the court at the same time. Thibodeau put them both on the floor early in the second quarter, and the Celtics immediately reeled off a 7-0 run. He tried it again for a brief spurt late in the third quarter and again midway through the fourth, but each time, the Celtics extended their lead. \u201cI think we played good,\u201d Toppin said. \u201cToday, I think I was like minus-22 when I was in the game. Like I said, we\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019ve just got to come back with a lot more energy and a lot more fight next game.\u201d After putting together a strong game against the 76ers in extended minutes, Toppin cooled off Saturday, recording seven points (including 1-for-5 from three) with six rebounds in 15 minutes. Randle came out strong and finished with 29 points and nine rebounds. And though his minutes with Toppin were not as productive on Saturday, he believes that lineup can help the Knicks moving forward. \u201cI love it,\u201d Randle said. \u201cPlay fast, spacing on the floor, obviously, on the offensive end. Being able to switch. The biggest thing is with that group is we just have to rebound. I think that\u2019s the one thing, even when he\u2019s not out there, it\u2019s not a 4 and 5.

As Americans once again adjust to a changed schedule this Sunday, more states this past year joined the group to make daylight saving permanent as soon as the federal government approves it . Twice a year, millions of Americans \u2014 with the exception of those living in Hawaii or Arizona \u2014 participate in setting their clocks either backward or forward. But over the years, support for ending a confusing practice that disturbs everyone's schedule continues to grow. The Sunshine Protection Act , which would make daylight saving permanent for the entire nation, remains stalled in Congress. But here's a breakdown of which states are getting ready in anticipation of its passage, according to a tally from the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2021, Alabama legislators, along with former Gov. Kay Ivey, passed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent as soon as the federal government also passed a similar measure. In 2022, the Colorado House unanimously passed a bipartisan bill that would make daylight saving permanent as soon as the U.S. government approved a similar measure. Delaware legislators passed a bill that would put the state in the Atlantic Standard Time zone, thereby permanently adopting daylight saving time, so long as the neighboring states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland also did the same. In 2018, Florida legislators became the first to pass a bill that would make daylight saving permanent in the state as soon as the federal government also approved the measure. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sponsored the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent for the entire country. In 2021, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also signed a bill into law that would make daylight saving permanent, pending congressional approval. Because the state is divided into two different time zones, legislators signed a measure in 2020 that would make daylight saving time permanent for the northern part of the state so long as the state of Washington did the same. In 2020, the Kentucky legislature passed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent, pending congressional approval. In 2020, Louisiana legislators passed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent as soon as the federal government passed a similar measure. After a bill that would have pushed the state's clock forward one hour by switching to Atlantic Standard Time failed in 2017, it didn't seem likely that the state would make a change . Until two years later, when the Maine legislature passed a bill stating that it would immediately adopt daylight saving time year-round, so long as the federal government approves it. In Minnesota, legislators passed two corresponding House and Senate bills that would make daylight saving permanent in the state following federal approval. In 2021, the Mississippi legislature passed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent as soon as the federal government enacted a similar measure. Similarly to Delaware, Montana legislators passed a bill that would make daylight saving time permanent as soon as several surrounding states do the same. In Ohio, legislators passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass the Sunshine Protection Act. In 2019, the Oregon legislature passed a bill that would make daylight saving time year-round. But one of its counties, Malheur, would be excluded from this change because it is in a different time zone than the rest of the state. In 2020, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed a bill into law that would make daylight saving permanent so long as the federal government also approved the measure. In 2019, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent following similar action from the federal government. Utah legislators passed a measure that would make daylight saving time permanent following action from the federal government and similar action in at least four of its surrounding states. In 2021, Washington legislators passed a bill that would make daylight saving permanent for the state as soon as the federal government approved it.

After graduating high school in Georgia in 1969, Herbert Ruffin was drafted into the military to serve as an infantryman in Vietnam. A year later, he was badly wounded in a firefight. He was awarded the Purple Heart and went on to serve his country for more than two decades. But when it came time to retire, Ruffin chose to continue living abroad. \"The quality of life for me, as a person of color \u2014 there was better opportunities for me to live in Germany,\" he says. \"I was born in the 1950s, so I came through some very challenging years being raised in the South.\" Ruffin, 72, remains a registered voter in Maryland, where he typically votes for Democrats. He says he still feels a deep sense of patriotism and takes voting as an American overseas seriously. \"Where I grew up, opportunities to vote were restricted,\" he says. \"I have a voice and I can encourage others to vote and let them know they can vote from abroad.\" Political power of overseas Americans is latent; it's waiting to be realized. Jay Sexton, University of Missouri Ruffin is one of at least 3 million American expatriates of voting age, a voting bloc that organizers and researchers are still trying to understand in an era of data-driven political targeting. It's a group with the potential to wield substantial power, if fully activated. \"It can be significant, because the margins in our polarized electoral climate are so tight,\" says Jay Sexton, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri. \"Political power of overseas Americans is latent; it's waiting to be realized.\" There are a couple reasons for that. Unlike the military, the exact number of civilian Americans living abroad isn't known. It's a diverse group that includes dual citizens, college students spending a semester abroad, retirees who've opted to spend their golden years in southern Spain and digital nomads who've taken their work abroad with a strong Wi-Fi connection and the blessing of their U.S. employer. The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), the program established to administer the law that enables overseas citizens to vote, estimates that in 2018, there were 4.8 million U.S. citizens living abroad, 3 million of whom were of voting age. Loading... \"One of the reasons why it's so difficult to get a really good estimate of how many American citizens actually live abroad is that the U.S. government doesn't gather much data on it,\" explains Tara Ginnane, a political scientist who studies the engagement of American citizens abroad. \"There are no surveys of people who are emigrating, there is no census category for people who live abroad, they aren't included in the census.\" Researchers can look at the numbers of expatriates who come into contact with consulates or embassies to help extrapolate data, but even then, it's a self-selecting group that doesn't tell the full story. According to the FVAP , Americans abroad are scattered across 186 countries, with the largest populations in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France and Israel. \"It's just really difficult to make generalizations about this extremely diverse, heterogeneous group of people,\" Ginnane says. One thing that unites this disparate group? Voter turnout. It's low \u2014 incredibly low. In the 2020 general election, the FVAP estimates 224,139 votes were cast by citizens abroad who aren't in the military, the equivalent to a voting rate of 7.8%. That compares to an overall turnout rate of 66.8% . But this elusive group holds a shimmering promise for political organizers who could crack the code to unlocking the bloc's potential. \"What we're looking at here is a large number of people that could swing elections if they turned out,\" says Sexton, of the University of Missouri. \"But despite efforts by both parties, it's been a really tough nut to crack.\" A common trap when thinking about the overseas vote is to conflate it with those serving in the military. The active-duty military has a much higher voter participation rate \u2014 47% voted in 2020. \"Military personnel are very much plugged into American institutions that are able to provide the logistical support, the reminders to vote and all the information on how to vote,\" Ginnane says. \"That's part of why overseas citizens' turnout is so low, because they don't have that logistical support, and they're on their own with figuring out how and when to vote.\" Common obstacles for overseas voters include: \"There's varying levels of interest and levels of people feeling themselves to be American enough and invested enough in the country's future to go get a ballot and bother to return it,\" Ginnane says.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images hide caption U.S. expats cast ballots in the 2020 Democratic primary at a polling station hosted by Democrats Abroad in Berlin, Germany. For the left, it's an apparatus called Democrats Abroad that is fully integrated into the party. Established in 1964, Democrats Abroad holds a global primary in presidential years and is considered one of the Democratic National Committee's 56 state and territory organizations. \"There have been a number of different organizations that have been the [right-leaning] counterpart to Democrats Abroad, but haven't quite had the staying power and institutional stamina that the Democrats have,\" Sexton says. \"The old quip about, you're not a member of an organized party if you're a Democrat, but when it comes to overseas, I think Democrats have been more organized.\" In September, Democrats Abroad hosted a virtual rally , where candidates in key states this election cycle \u2014 like Senate nominees John Fetterman, Mandela Barnes and Tim Ryan \u2014 made video appeals to get out the vote. \"American citizens living abroad are often the margin of victory in our elections,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at the rally in a prerecorded message. \"When you vote, you make a difference. In 2018, when we took the House, our blue wave was tiny drops of water, very close races, and the margin of victory was from the military and overseas ballots.\" Candice Kerestan, the international chair of Democrats Abroad, told NPR that a big component of this cycle's organizing efforts was a worldwide voter registration day, where the group set up registration booths in over 50 countries. \"We also run social media and digital advertising campaigns, and we run a voter help desk around the clock so if people have questions on how to vote from abroad, we'll assist them,\" she says. \"Living in Sweden has definitely influenced my perspectives,\" says Lauren Ell, a Republican voter. Lauren Ell hide caption \"Living in Sweden has definitely influenced my perspectives,\" says Lauren Ell, a Republican voter. Lauren Ell, a Republican voter who moved from California to Sweden in 2016 to be with her Swedish partner, says Democrats' organization and built-in infrastructure make her wistful. \"I have found the Democrats to be much more organized,\" she says. \"They are investing in their organization for Americans living abroad, whereas the Republican Party does not.\" There was an organization called Republicans Abroad that closed in 2013, leading most of its chapters to migrate to Republicans Overseas, a group that is active but doesn't have the same involvement between the national Republican Party as its Democratic counterpart. Ell, 34, started a group called Nordic Republicans to help mobilize American conservatives in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark. She says these voices have a lot to offer their party back home. \"When you have Americans who are actually having to work with the systems and the governments abroad, they provide a really important perspective,\" she says. \"When it comes to health care, when it comes to gun control \u2014 I think it's really important to hear directly from Americans living in Sweden what exactly it is like.\" After the U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion on overturning Roe v.

Carol Moore, who lives in London with a second home in Palm Beach County, Fla., leads the Florida team of Democrats Abroad. She's been phone banking for the midterm election. \"Many of us track what happens in America and act as ambassadors,\" she says, adding many U.K. citizens approach her with questions on U.S. policy, including the recent Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion. \"It was truly shocking,\" says Moore, who was a law student in the 1970s when Roe v. Wade was decided. \"I feel like the U.S. is regressing,\" she sighs. \"And also, if they're taking this right away from women, what will be next in terms of racial equality, LGBTQ equality?\" For Nicolas Conquer, a French dual citizen living in Paris who is originally from Minnesota, the top issue is inflation and the economy \u2014 closely matching national polls of stateside voters. \"Prices surging, inflation, energy \u2014 the current administration has totally failed,\" says Conquer, 36, the spokesperson for Republican Overseas France. \"The repercussions of living abroad through these reckless policies in the U.S. \u2014 we're going to be affected by restrictions, cutting pipelines like the Keystone XL Pipeline, being more dependent [on] other sources,\" he says. \"It's really going to affect us locally, wherever we are, whether it be countries in Europe or other areas in the world are really going to be directly impacted by the policy conducted by the White House and supported by the Congress.\" Cory Lemke is the international treasurer for Democrats Abroad. He says it was the 2016 presidential election that made him want to get involved with helping citizens abroad vote. Cory Lemke hide caption Cory Lemke is an Arizona voter who's lived in South Korea \u2014 home of his birth family \u2014 for 10 years. The international treasurer for Democrats Abroad says watching from afar as false claims of election fraud and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol unfurled was upsetting and led him to reflect on just how fragile democracy is. \"It's really odd, because our democracy in South Korea is because of the United States,\" he says. \"And so much of the narrative in South Korea and democracy is about the United States and living up to that standard. It's really weird to see the United States having these issues with the preservation of democracy and perceived issues with election integrity.\" Lemke adds that living in another country allows him to look at U.S. policy \u2014 and what is possible \u2014 with new eyes. \"South Korea is by no stretch of the imagination a communist-socialist country,\" he says. \"You know, we've fought a war about this, and we have universal health care and to watch that be the conversation in the debates in the U.S. is really odd. I feel I have to educate people about universal health care and how wonderful it is.\" Lemke says his adopted parents, whom he calls Reagan Republicans, have shifted their perspective on health care policy somewhat, given his experiences in South Korea. \"They see the benefits, they see a lived example of \u2014 OK, maybe universal health care isn't a communist program.\" Political scientist Ginnane warns against thinking of overseas voters as the 51st state, with equivalent political might. \"It's important to resist that temptation a little because one has to remember that they're voting in all 50 states,\" she explains. \"So their voting potential is kind of cracked and diffused.\" And since tracking this group remains challenging, it's not possible for campaigns to zero in on which constituencies could have the biggest impact in contentious races. But even with low turnout and challenges with mobilization, overseas voters have, at times, played an important role in elections. Perhaps the most notable example is the presidential election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush . Gore was narrowly ahead. A cache of late-arriving Florida ballots from overseas \u2014 both military and civilian \u2014 gave Bush the edge by 537 votes. \"These votes really mattered,\" Ginnane says. \"They don't matter any more than any individual vote but in a very tight election like that, and especially when they arrive late and are counted separately, they begin to look as though they're extremely influential.\" A similar story played out in 2006, when overseas voters played a role in Virginian Jim Webb's Senate victory . And in 2020, thousands of ballots were counted from overseas in states like Arizona and Georgia \u2014 two states crucial to Joe Biden's presidential win.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [20.06253433227539, 6.232411861419678]}, {"title": "Past is prologue in two new books that explore the Trump era", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/06/1134372699/past-is-prologue-in-two-new-books-that-explore-the-trump-era", "description": "The two books, written by veteran journalists, depict a political landscape that few Americans could have foreseen less than a decade ago and offer a hint at the future.", "content": "The genesis of the Trump-era and its ultimate impact on American politics is explored in two new books. NPR hide caption The genesis of the Trump-era and its ultimate impact on American politics is explored in two new books. Maggie Haberman's biography Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America has been among the most anticipated accounts of the 45th president's impact on American politics. Robert Draper's new book on the post-Trump state of Republican politics, Weapons of Mass Delusion: When the Republican Party Lost Its Mind, has not had nearly as much attention. But moving swiftly across timeframes and landscapes, both depict a political world that few Americans could have foreseen less than a decade ago. They also hint at a future many will fear. Haberman has one subject, a singular actor who has wrought much of the change in the landscape himself. Draper works with an ensemble of characters who are far less familiar, but offer compelling insight into Trump's surprising rise within the Republican Party. Together, they help us understand how Trump has held sway in that party even as his single chaotic term led to the loss of the House and the Senate and the White House \u2013and how he has maintained party dominance even after his abortive attempt to subvert the 2020 election. Haberman covered Trump first as a young reporter for the New York Post , then for New York Daily News, Politico, and finally for the New York Times. Her persistence and Trump's own love-hate fixation on the Times have long supplied her with unparalleled access to his moods and media manipulation. Trying to handle all this as even-handedly as possible has earned her admiration and anger alike. Some have called her the \"Trump Whisperer\" and worse. But Haberman deploys a deep sense of Trump's origins and career, including his relationships with New York's mayors and powerful Democratic ward bosses such as Meade Esposito. Haberman helps us understand how his lifelong desire for stardom pushed him to bid for the presidency and how his unorthodox credentials and tactics enabled him to win. She has a witness' eye for much that she relates, as when Trump first came to Washington to flirt with a presidential candidacy in 2011: \"When he took the stage, with the Apprentice theme song \"For the Love of Money\" blaring overhead, the room was packed, a mix of religious activists, libertarian-minded college students, and corporate lobbyists unlikely ever to assemble anywhere else.\" In a gripping chapter titled \"Rising on a Lie,\" Haberman describes how Trump sorted out themes and gimmicks he might use to take Obama down. He hit on a theory \"that had floated through the right-win information eco-system since before (Obama) was elected,\" the idea that he had not been born in the U.S. and was therefore not constitutionally qualified to be president. The so-called \"birther controversy\" had played out in 2008 and died out. Trump said \"I think this might work,\" and brought it back. But having been present for the White House years, she also shows how poorly the same life history had prepared him for the office itself. He came to office still looking to his various gurus from Gotham, mayors like Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani and bigtime sports figures such as George Steinbrenner. And always, as other Trump biographers have recounted, relying on the teachings of Roy Cohn, the legendary lawyer for senators and mobsters who shaped Trump's worldview. Haberman begins her download with a succinct prologue that outlines much of what she wants us to know. Five hundred pages later, in her Epilogue, she writes \"Trump had proven that the majority of Washington Republicans who had initially opposed him were exactly as craven as he had said they were, as he bent them to his will because they saw personally opportunity or necessity for survival, even after the Capitol riot.\" That is the link from the Trump-centric era described in Confidence Man to the even more foreboding outlook in Draper's Weapons of Mass Delusion . Draper locates Trump in the worst traditions of his party \u2013 or of any political party anywhere. These include both the cynical politics of Machiavellian self-interest and the perpetuation of division within the body politic in service of that self-interest. Draper's access is also the key to his reporting, but it is won one interview at a time with persistence and old-school shoe leather. Draper, who writes for The New York Times Sunday Magazine, is well-known for getting out of Washington and working the hustings. He goes to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's home district in Bakersfield, Calif., to interview people McCarthy knew in high school contacts. McCarthy figures prominently in Weapons , not only because he could potentially become Speaker of the House (assuming a Republican majority beginning in January) but because he personifies the Trump transformation of the GOP. We learn that McCarthy was a teenager when he was first attracted to that era's version of Trump as skyscraper builder and golden-touch businessman. Now known for Trump's nickname for him (\"My Kevin\"), McCarthy had a moment of rebellion on the night of January 6, but Draper reveals him repenting that moment step by step until he was back on the Trump track. For contrast, Draper gives us generous helpings of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the Republicans on the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol. But these are mournful, head-wagging sessions that underscore the interviewees' despair. But while touching on the big names as he must, Draper returns to the grit of the political trenches. His fascination is with the GOP's fringe and its dramatic departures from mainstream politics. His passion is for fact-checking the fantasy that feeds those departures. When Draper saw a campaign ad referring to illegal immigrants leaving \"a thousand pounds of rubbish\" on the streets of San Luis, Arizona, he went to the little border town himself and interviewed many of the officials there to fact-check the ad (which turned out to be wildly misleading). The politician behind that ad was Paul Gosar, a dentist and junior member of Congress from northern Arizona, well-removed from the border but obsessed with it all the same. Gosar appears as the target of Draper's first chapter and again and often at length in Weapons . Also recurrent is Gosar's chief of staff Tom Van Flein, who previously had worked for Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Gosar and Van Flein have shared much of their time and worldview with Draper, opening deep recesses of the current conservative movement to him. Gosar also provides a narrative connection back to former congressman Steve King of Iowa, who was condemned by House Republicans for his comments on white supremacy and another connection to Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman described as Gosar's \"mentee\" in chapters with titles such as \"Arc of the Crazy.\" Greene's unswerving devotion to Trump and tireless pursuit of social media fame have propelled her to a prominence rarely granted to first-termers. To give her, or Gosar, so much space will prompt disbelief. Are these outliers really the forerunners of Republicans in the future? Draper is clearly arguing that they are. A film director begins a shot focused on the face of a single figure, then \"pulls focus\" back to reveal a wider cast of characters and the set that surrounds them all. So Haberman has given us a long and thorough exposure of Trump as the protagonist in our present politics, and Draper has pulled focus to the crowd of lesser pretenders in his wake \u2013 and the elements of the nation that have embraced them all. It is now widely expected that Republicans this month will easily erase the five-seat majority that makes Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat, the Speaker of the House. It is also an even-money bet that Mitch McConnell will be back as Senate Majority Leader as that chamber breaks its 50-50 tie in favor of the GOP. If either chamber goes Republican, Donald J. Trump, the former president can be expected to declare himself vindicated. There will be talk of his return to the White House, and he may make some formal moves in that direction. But in reading these two tomes, it is hard to escape the impression that Trump's career has passed its apogee. Just as President Biden is widely expected to pass on seeking a second term, Trump is no longer the best fit for the Trumpist party he created. An indictment, or more than one, is not the best launching pad for a third presidential campaign. If that proves to be the case, the portents of Draper's reporting are the more pressing for our present moment. This is not to take anything away from the timeliness, breadth and richness of Haberman's magnum opus . There is, after all, no guarantee Trump will not be president again.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt \u2014 Envoys from around the globe gathered Sunday in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks on tackling climate change that come as the world also grapples with multiple crises, including the war in Ukraine, high inflation, food shortages and an energy crunch. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the planet was heading toward irreversible \"climate chaos\" unless countries find a way to put the world back on track to cut emissions and help poor countries cope with the impacts of global warming. More than 40,000 participants have been registered for this year's talks, reflecting the sense of urgency as major weather events around the world impact many people and cost billions of dollars in repairs. Egypt said over 120 world leaders will attend, many of them speaking at a high-level event on Nov. 7-8, while U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to arrive later in the week. But many top figures including China's President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India were not planning to come, casting doubt on whether the talks in Egypt could result in any major deals to cut emissions without two of the world's biggest polluters. Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the talks were being overshadowed by Russia's attack on Ukraine that has triggered political and economic upheaval around the world. \"But 2022 must not become a lost year for climate protection,\" she said in a statement. \"For many states, it's about the survival of their population and their culture. For them, the climate crisis remains the most important security issue, not Russia's war in Europe.\" Baerbock said Germany was willing to show solidarity with poor countries, including on the thorny issue of compensation for losses resulting from climate change caused by rich countries' emissions.

New York-based Human Rights Watch, citing Egyptian media, said authorities had also arrested dozens of people for calling for protests. \"It is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly,\" Adam Coogle, the group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Human Rights Watch said it had had joined about 1,400 groups from around the world urging Egypt to lift the restrictions on civil society groups.

Jets CB Sauce Gardner vs. Bills WR Stefon Diggs Diggs is third in the NFL with 55 receptions and has the most touchdowns (seven) among wide receivers this year. Gardner has gotten off to a great start in his rookie season. He is credited with allowing just 13 yards in man coverage this season. The Jets do not usually travel their cornerbacks, meaning Gardner likely won\u2019t follow Diggs around. But he said he would welcome the challenge if he did. Even if Gardner and Diggs don\u2019t face off on every snap, they will see plenty of each other, and this will be a good test for the Jets budding superstar. Defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said Gardner has a \u201cSuperman\u201d mentality to him. \u201c[The best corners] have this mentality that they can never be beat. He\u2019s got that to him,\u201d Ulbrich said. \u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous confidence. His football IQ for a rookie is way ahead of most \u2014 still got a long way to go in that way. His thirst for knowledge and the way he works and operates on a day to day basis is really cool to see. He\u2019s got the makeup of a guy that\u2019s played some time in this League, excited about the future.\u201d This is a tough matchup for the Jets . The Bills do not appear to have any weaknesses at the moment. The Jets\u2019 offense is still trying to find itself without Breece Hall, and the defense is going to struggle to stop Josh Allen. Bills 30, Jets 13 Miller time: The Bills\u2019 core is mostly the same as it has been the past few years, with one very large exception. Buffalo signed edge rusher Von Miller to a six-year, $120 million contract in March, and he has already paid dividends. The 33-year-old has six sacks and is going to be a problem to deal with for Jets tackles Duane Brown and Cedric Ogbuehi. Miller missed practice time this week with an ankle injury, but he is expected to be full strength on Sunday. \u201cStill a force to be reckoned with,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen [the Broncos in 2021] made the trade to L.A., a lot of people wrote him off thinking he was kind of starting to decline, and he showed that that was wrong. Just a very talented athlete, man, very explosive, quick, crafty. He\u2019s playing like he has something to prove, so it\u2019s a great challenge.\u201d Get Zach back: The Jets are 4-1 with Zach Wilson starting at quarterback and had found a winning formula with stingy defense, a strong running game and Wilson protecting the ball. That went out the window last week against the Patriots when Wilson had three brutal interceptions. This week has been about getting Wilson back on schedule. We\u2019ll see how he does against a Bills defense that has 14 takeaways this year. \u201cThe mindset is within 24 hours, we\u2019ve all moved on,\u201d Wilson said of last week. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve learned from those mistakes. There\u2019s things I want back, but those are behind me and you try to reapply them in practice.\u201d Looking for Moore: The drama around Elijah Moore continues. The wide receiver played just 10 snaps last week and had one target with no catches. The Jets did not trade him before the deadline Tuesday, and now it is on the coaches to figure out how to incorporate Moore into the offense. \u201cFor sure we\u2019ll find a way to make sure that it balances out the way we want it to,\u201d head coach Robert Saleh said, \u201cbut at the same time \u2014 like I said with Corey [Davis] being down, getting [Denzel] Mims out there, keeping a bigger body out at the Z, and Garrett [Wilson is] playing at such a high level right now to give him the opportunity to play football too \u2026 we\u2019ve got to make sure we find more opportunities to for [Moore].\u201d Status Q: Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October after a monster five games. Williams had 4.5 sacks, 23 tackles, four tackles for a loss, 12 quarterback hits, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked field goal in the month. Williams will chase around Bills quarterback Josh Allen this week, a challenge he is looking forward to. \u201cHe\u2019s like huge,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s like 6-[foot]-5 I think, can stiff-arm, can run the ball, can jump, can hurdle. He\u2019s basically like a running back who can throw the ball real good. He\u2019s an elite quarterback. When he has to throw a deep ball, he has an elite arm. He\u2019s a super powerful quarterback.

Not crazy about laying with the Cards, who continue to be less than meets the eye, to our way of thinking. Take the points and run. Buffalo continues to kick tail and take names in division matchups, and this looks like more of the same, so long as Jets\u2019 skill-position players continue to encounter issues moving the ball down the field with any sustained efficiency. Atlanta has enjoyed a sustained history of playing the Bolts stiff, and wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised by another close call \u2014 though the prevailing Falcons injury rundown could provoke prudent levels of concern. Can easily envision Miami continuing to give a good account of itself while working its way toward a postseason berth, but far from certain that Miami offense will have a high old time against defensively rough-and-ready Bears. It\u2019s tough to give too much credence to the fledgling Panthers, given the brace of headliner skill people the Bengals are able to roll out there on a consistent basis, when they\u2019re on their mettle. Is D\u2019Andre Swift going to start for the Honolulu Blues? Just how far has Aaron Rodgers slipped from his exalted peak? So many questions \u2026 so many slick-and-slippery answers, especially when you consider Green Bay\u2019s shaky offensive line. The spread seems sharp, too. Jacksonville is enduring this without a week off following its latest excursion to London. This doesn\u2019t figure to be a piece of cake, without some kind of sustained break in the action. What\u2019s more, this is the Raiders\u2019 fourth road trip in their last five outings. Jacksonville, by default. This is primarily because we\u2019re more bullish on young Colts QB Sam Ehlinger than some are. The young former Longhorn has considerable upside, from our point of view, and we\u2019d be pleased to benefit from any measure of precocious improvement Ehlinger may display, posthaste. Like many league entities, Minnesota typically doesn\u2019t match its optimal home form when operating out of suitcases. Curious to see to what extent Washington QB Taylor Heinicke will develop with additional playing time. Worth watching. We\u2019ve been picking up, taking advantage of sustained Rams underachievement when on offense. Accordingly, we\u2019d feel much better about this side if key offensive operative Cooper Kupp is able to play despite his iffy ankle (check status).

Yes, we\u2019re fishing for a surprise package in this spot \u2014 but Kansas City is unlikely to take this foe with the utmost seriousness, and we wouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to be scared off, even should Tennessee QB Malik Willis start under center rather than Ryan Tannehill.

He\u2019ll likely begin at Triple-A in 2023, but he could emerge as an option to be promoted to The Bronx at some point later in the season. Then there\u2019s Kiner-Falefa, whom manager Aaron Boone defended again on Friday, saying he had a \u201creally good defensive year\u201d at shortstop, citing internal metrics. Some advanced stats show Kiner-Falefa struggled on defense, while others back up Boone\u2019s theory. But there\u2019s no getting around the fact Kiner-Falefa was benched during the postseason because of his defense. Boone said at the time the shortstop was \u201cpressing\u201d because of his mistakes. Asked about Kiner-Falefa\u2019s admission he was playing poorly on defense, Boone said it was merely a matter of the player\u2019s own high standards. \u201cHe\u2019s tough,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe expects a lot of himself. That\u2019s part of him saying that. His bar is [high], of, \u2018This is who I should be defensively.\u2019 The reality is, he was having a really good defensive year. He had some struggles along the way or a bad error [and] seemingly the next play would highlight the error because we gave up a run or whatever. But he always bounced back from that. That\u2019s who he is in being really accountable.\u201d Boone is right about that. Kiner-Falefa frequently blamed himself publicly for losses because of errors he\u2019d made, even if they played a small role in the defeat. But Cashman noted Friday what Kiner-Falefa\u2019s role was when the Yankees acquired him \u2014 along with Josh Donaldson and minor league catcher Ben Rortvedt \u2014 from Minnesota in exchange for Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela during spring training. \u201c[Kiner-Falefa] gave us an opportunity to bridge the gap while our kids continued to develop,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said of Peraza and Volpe. \u201cEveryone in this industry knows we have some potentially impactful young prospects we\u2019re developing and they needed some more time.\u201d Cashman added he thought Kiner-Falefa\u2019s production, both on defense and at-bat, \u201cwas kind of along the lines of what we expected.\u201d Clearly, that wasn\u2019t good enough in the postseason.

That\u2019s what it is.\u201d Thompson and a cousin were eating at Ruth\u2019s Chris on Friday night when a large group nearby got into an argument with the restaurant staff over the bill, sources and prosecutors alleged. But something sparked members of the group to turn their attention to Thompson \u2013 possibly a comment that the group was being too loud, sources said. One woman from the larger group allegedly went to Thompson and told her, \u201cYou look like s\u2014t, the way you dress.\u201d The eventual victim started throwing punches and hit Thompson\u2019s cousin, a source previously old The Post. Cellphone video of the attack obtained by investigators allegedly showed Thompson standing on a chair with a steak knife while shouting, before she makes a stabbing motion toward the victim, prosecutors said in court Saturday night. \u201cI\u2019m really upset about the whole situation. We were attacked,\u201d Thompson\u2019s cousin told The Post. \u201cWe were having dinner. We were having a nice quiet dinner and we were attacked. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d After the stabbing, the two ran from the restaurant without paying. Thompson was arrested after 2 a.m. Saturday after cops tracked her down using her name from the dinner reservation, prosecutors alleged. When cops showed her the video of her attack she admitted it was her and said she had gotten into an argument but \u201cclaimed to have no memory of the actual stabbing,\u201d prosecutors alleged. She was charged with assault and menacing but prosecutors said they may increase the charges after reviewing the victim\u2019s medical records.

The Bills (6-1) have looked like one of the best teams in the league all season \u2014 if not the best.

Allen has Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis to throw to, and Buffalo added speed back Nyheim Hines at the trading deadline this week.

Ryan Lindgren, who was held out of practice Saturday with an upper-body injury sustained against the Bruins , has been declared doubtful to play. That is a rarity for a group whose top pairings have been essentially unchanged for the past two seasons, but the choice in front of Rangers coach Gerard Gallant comes down to whether he prefers to keep K\u2019Andre Miller and Jacob Trouba together or to move Miler to play alongside Adam Fox, with someone else \u2014 presumably Zac Jones or Libor Hajek \u2014 on Trouba\u2019s left. One option was ruled out by Gallant on Saturday: playing Braden Schneider with Fox and necessitating that one play on his off side. Miller skated with Fox for the majority of practice Saturday, though that came with the caveat that Trouba had a maintenance day. \u201cDon\u2019t go by today\u2019s D,\u201d Gallant said. So there will be some intrigue during warmups Sunday, though the option of Miller and Fox playing together is tantalizing enough to require closer examination. Per Natural Stat Trick, Miller and Fox have been on the ice together for 173:37 at five-on-five since the start of the 2020-21 season and have a 51.82 expected goals percentage together. More than half of that time, however, came in 2020-21, when Miller was a rookie instead of a top-pair defenseman now averaging 22:04 per game. The two also skated together in the preseason this year against the Islanders, when Trouba and Lindgren sat. \u201cI get to sit on the bench and watch him do his thing 99 percent of the time,\u201d Miller told The Post. \u201cI think it\u2019d be pretty cool to get the experience to play with him. A high-skilled player, we\u2019ll make the most of it, have fun.\u201d The luxury of the Rangers\u2019 situation is such that losing Lindgren means they will get to play Fox, the 2021 Norris Trophy winner, with Miller, who could contend for the honor in the future. Coaches like to say there is no such thing as a top pair. Gallant can do so credibly. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that at all,\u201d Gallant said of the ripple effects from Lindgren\u2019s injury. \u201cIt\u2019s not like K\u2019Andre and Trouba are second fiddle to those guys. They\u2019re a big part of our group. I put those four on against anybody.\u201d Shaking things up by necessity is never perfect. This situation, however, might help the Rangers, who have not been operating at their best of late. The 5-2 loss to the Bruins on Thursday at the Garden knocked their record down to 6-4-2. If that defensive change comes to fruition, the most important factor for Miller and Fox will be communicating with each other when they are used to such things being automatic. \u201cWhen you play with somebody for so long, obviously there\u2019s little things where you don\u2019t even have to talk,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s just talking without talking, really. You make eye contact and you know what the other person\u2019s doing. With playing with somebody new, I always try to talk a little bit more, let them know where I am, where the pressure is.\u201d The Rangers are not sweating the possibility of that scenario. Instead, Fox echoed Miller\u2019s language that it would be a rare chance to play alongside someone whose game he often admires from afar. \u201cYou see what he does out there, the way he skates and the way he defends is good, too,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI\u2019m out there with him [Saturday], like I said earlier, a lot of communication and trying to feed off each other.\u201d Regardless of whom Fox is with on Sunday, the only adjustment he will make is in his communication style \u2014 not his play. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re really gonna change the way you play too much based on who you\u2019re with,\u201d Fox said.

Baker, who won a World Series as a player with the Los Angeles Dodgers and had been to the Fall Classic twice before as a skipper, is the oldest championship manager in any of the four major North American sports. The win came 20 years after a near-miss, when he came within five outs of taking the title while guiding the San Francisco Giants. \"What's next? I said if I win one, I want to win two,\" Baker said afterward. Houston's coaching and training staffs circled around Baker after Nick Castellanos flied out to end it, jumping up and down, and chanting \"Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!\" in the dugout before they joined the players on the field. Astros rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a was the World Series MVP after getting another key hit, a single to set up Alvarez's drive. The 25-year-old star born in the Dominican Republic also won a Gold Glove award and AL Championship Series MVP \u2014 Pe\u00f1a is the first hitter to win those three awards in a career, and he did it all in his first season, per OptaSTATS. A year after watching the Atlanta Braves clinch the World Series title at Minute Maid Park, the Astros went 11-2 in the postseason became the first team to seal the championship at home since the 2013 Boston Red Sox. Alvarez homered for the first time since going deep in the first two games this postseason. Christian V\u00e1zquez added an RBI single later in the inning to make it 4-1. Valdez earned his second win of this Series. He had been in the dugout only a few minutes after throwing his 93rd and final pitch while striking out nine over six innings. But the lefty had walked off the mound with the wild-card Phillies up 1-0 on Kyle Schwarber's homer leading off the sixth. Schwarber, who hit his third homer in the past four games, rounded the bases waving his raised empty hand in the same motion as the fans with their towels. But by the time Schwarber batted in the eighth, the NL's home run leader was reduced to bunting, trying for a hit to stir a dormant Phillies offense. His bunt went foul with two strikes, resulting in a strikeout. In the sixth, Houston got two runners on base against Wheeler for the first time in the game, when Mart\u00edn Maldonado was hit by a pitch, Jose Altuve grounded into a forceout and Pe\u00f1a singled. Phillies manager Rob Thomson went to left-handed reliever Jos\u00e9 Alvarado to face the lefty slugger for the fourth time in the series \u2014 Alvarez had popped out twice and been hit by a pitch the first three times. \"I thought Wheels still had really good stuff. It wasn't about that. It was just I thought the matchup was better with Alvarado on Alvarez at that time,\" Thomson said. And Alvarado had allowed only three homers to lefty hitters in his six big league seasons, until his 2-1 pitch, when Alvarez crushed the 99 mph sinker. \"It's kind of a dirty inning and I thought, I mean, going into the series it was always kind of Alvarado on Alvarez,\" Thomson said. \"It was the sixth inning and I felt like the normal back end of the bullpen guys could get through it.\" Alvarez hadn't homered since Game 2 of the AL Division Series against Seattle, when his two-run shot in the sixth inning put them up to stay. That came after his game-ending, three-run shot in Game 1 for an 8-7 win. Houston won an American League-best 106 games and reached its fourth World Series during a span in which it made it to the AL Championship Series six seasons in a row. The Astros made their only other World Series appearance in 2005, while still in the National League, and were swept in four games by the Chicago White Sox. This was their third ALCS and second consecutive World Series since former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers revealed after the 2019 season, when he had gone from Houston for two years since being part of their 2017 championship, that the team had used a camera in center field to steal signs and signal hitters on which pitches to expect by banging on a garbage can. \"That will probably never go away but I think this just proves how good this team is and how good it's been for a long time,\" Astros owner Jim Crane said on the field afterward. Philadelphia was 22-29 when Joe Girardi was fired in early June and replaced by bench coach Thomson, the 59-year-old baseball lifer getting his first chance a big league manager \u2014 he was on the Yankees big league staff for 10 seasons with Girardi, and was part of their last World Series and title in 2009.

Sunday will be an exception.", "content": "Considering they\u2019ve been one of the most successful NFL franchises in recent years, the Chiefs don\u2019t have a lot of scores to settle. Sunday night at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs (5-2) will host the Titans (5-2), will be an exception. On several levels. Most recently, the Titans waxed the Chiefs, 27-3, last season. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready,\u201d Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes told reporters this week when asked about that previous meeting. \u201cAnd they beat our ass.\u201d The Chiefs, who enter the game with a one-game lead over the Chargers in the AFC West, have the Super Bowl appearances (two in the past three seasons), but the Titans have had their number \u2014 and the number of their head coach Andy Reid, against whom they\u2019re 7-1. \u201cThey have that mentality that they\u2019re going to come in and win, and a lot of times in this league when you don\u2019t have the confidence coming in, you\u2019re going to lose,\u2019\u2019 Mahomes said. \u201cBut when you have a team that is as confident as you, it\u2019s going to be a battle. You watch that on film and see how you played, it wasn\u2019t just them beating us. We played bad and they just put it down on us at the end of the day. We have to understand they\u2019re going to be ready to go.\u201d The Titans, who have a two-game lead over the Colts in the AFC South, have won five of the past six meetings between the teams, including playoffs. Kansas City\u2019s one win came in the 2019 AFC Championship game, which sent the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV. Tennessee also comes into the game as the hottest team in the league, other than undefeated Philadelphia, having won five in a row after starting 0-2. Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who hopes to return after missing the win over Houston last week with an ankle injury, called Arrowhead Stadium a \u201ctough [and] fun place to play.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s an atmosphere that you dream about when you\u2019re a kid, going into a rowdy road environment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThey love football. They\u2019re loud. They\u2019re into it the whole game.\u201d One way for the Titans to quiet the rabid Kansas City faithful is with running back Derrick Henry, who rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Texans last Sunday. Henry has rushed for 563 yards in 112 attempts with five TDs in Tennessee\u2019s past four games. He was held to 69 rushing yards rushing in the Chiefs\u2019 win in the AFC title game in January 2020. Henry gained just 86 rushing yards in the meeting last season, and the Titans won big anyway. \u201cThere are going to be things that you\u2019re going to do to try and stop him \u2014 I think the whole NFL has tried that somewhere,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player, and you\u2019re not going to stop him on every play. You just want to get the numbers up where it\u2019s a reasonable number of stops.\u201d One number that\u2019s difficult to ignore is Reid\u2019s uncanny 20-3 career record as a head coach in games after a bye week. And the Chiefs are coming off their bye week. Tannehill was replaced last week by third-round pick Malik Willis \u2014 who wasn\u2019t asked to do a lot in the passing game, going 6-for-10 for 55 yards with an interception. Something to watch Sunday will be how much the Chiefs incorporate receiver Kadarius Toney, whom they acquired in a trade with the Giants before the trade deadline. Toney, who had trouble staying on the field with hamstring injuries and other issues, has claimed he\u2019s healthy and ready to play. This week is the first of two games the Chiefs will be playing without defensive end Frank Clark, who was suspended for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy. But their first-round pick, cornerback Trent McDuffie, is expected to play for the first time since hurting his hamstring in the season opener at Arizona. The Titans and Chiefs are tied for the second-best record in the AFC behind the Bills, who have beaten them both, which means this game could have playoff implications in terms of seeding and home-field advantage should they meet again. \u201cI just focus on ways that we think we can beat the Chiefs and how we can prepare,\u2019\u2019 Titans coach Mike Vrabel told reporters this week. \u201cAll that stuff really takes care of itself.\u2019\u2019", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-28.908931732177734, -9.527358055114746]}, {"title": "\u2018SNL\u2019 cold open offers up more \u2018exciting\u2019 Democratic candidates ahead of \u2018big yikes\u2019 midterms", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/snl-cold-open-offers-more-exciting-democratic-candidates-ahead-big-yikes-midterms", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\"'s last cold open sketch before the midterms revolved around President Biden trying to spice up the lineup of Democratic candidates.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash Top Entertainment Headlines of the week Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. \"Saturday Night Live\"\u2019s cold open this weekend had President Biden (Andrew Dismukes) concerned about the \"big yikes\" midterms on Tuesday and wondering if the liberals should spice up their candidate lineup. \"This Tuesday, the midterm elections will determine the fate of our democracy and let\u2019s just say: big yikes!\" Dismukes, while standing behind a presidential podium, emphasized as the commander-in-chief at the top of the show. \"Folks, I\u2019m trying like hell, I promise.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The new pastor at Bridgetown Church, a nondenominational church in downtown Portland, Oregon, has a mission. Tyler Station, also a husband and father of three, wants people to get real about prayer \u2014 which is why he wrote a new book, \"Praying Like Monks, Living Like Fools: An Invitation to the Wonder and Mystery of Prayer.\" Prayer is difficult even for committed Christians , he told Fox News Digital in a recent phone interview. \"I would say the heart of our difficulty is that we approach prayer with a level of formality,\" he said. ALL SOULS DAY: HERE'S WHY PRIESTS ADVISE PRAYING FOR THE DEAD \"But that type of formality in prayer is actually never described in Scripture.\" People don't worry about \"doing conversation wrong\" with other human beings, he said \u2014 yet many may fear getting prayer \"wrong\" because we've been taught it should be more \"formal.\" Tyler Staton of Portland, Oregon is a pastor, husband and father of three. He said Jesus is \"always going beyond\" people's comfort zone. (Savannah Lauren Photography) \"I think most people, regardless of how long they've prayed, are approaching God with a higher level formality than Jesus reveals in Scripture,\" said the pastor. There's a better way to approach it, he revealed. Why prayer is hard, even for committed believers \"If you think of the ways and names by which God is described in Scripture, he is our father, friend, comforter and advocate,\" said Staton. \"And yet I think the way that we approach God is, typically, [as] \u2018boss.\u2019\" Most people first encounter prayer by going to a church and hearing a pastor pray,\" he said. \"So we learned [by] listening to a professional pray.\" \"God's endgame is to reunite, in unbroken intimacy, with all people.\" He added of the \"professionals,\" \"They use words I would never use in ordinary speech.\" WHAT ARE 'ANGEL NUMBERS' AND WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SEEING THEM? The \"antidote\" to this prayer formality is the Psalms, said Staton \u2014 \"the prayers of David, the exemplary prayers that have framed the Hebrew prayer life in the temple, leading up to Jesus.\" \"We learned [by] listening to a professional pray,\" Staton said of the formality of many people's prayer style. (iStock) Staton said that Jesus himself \"quoted the Psalms more than any other book in the Bible.\" What Scripture reveals about talking to God The Psalms are \"littered\" with all sorts of things \"we think we're not allowed to say to God,\" said Staton \u2014 \"including, \u2018Where are you, God? Why are you doing this? You should be doing that. I feel like you forgot me.\u2019\" These are \"things you never hear the pastor at the front of the church say.\" \"God's endgame is to reunite, in unbroken intimacy, with all people,\" said Staton. \"The biblical story is that through the consequences of sin, a seam was ripped through that intimacy.\" AMERICANS RECITE BIBLE'S NEW TESTAMENT IN HISTORIC EVENT: \u2018THE GREAT RECITAL\u2019 He added, \"That\u2019s what happened in the fall \u2014 there's suddenly broken intimacy with God and broken intimacy with each other.\" Prayer at its highest is \"a taste of that intimacy restored,\" said Staton. \"For now, it's kind of like an appetizer.

THESE FAITHFUL DEVOTIONS MAY HELP BLESS OUR CHILDREN He also said, \"God is all-knowing, so if we're faking it, he knows. He would prefer if we're just honest with him in our prayers.\" Staton said he believes that bringing conflicting thoughts, emotions and even anger to God in prayer leads to a deeper relationship with him. \"Anthropologically, I would just say we know that conflict is a portal to deeper intimacy,\" he noted. (See Pastor Staton as he preaches in the video shown in the tweet below.) \"Everyone who's married , everyone who has a best friend, everyone who's worked closely with a colleague for years \u2014 they have encountered conflict, worked through it and actually developed a deeper relationship as a result,\" he said.

It's everything .\" He added, \"It's the source of power. It's the place of love. It's the life source of the Christian life.\" What true, honest prayer brings \u2014 and how God responds Staton said that he has found a \"disciplined rhythm of communion\" with God through prayer. \"And that has been most profoundly preserved in the church through the monastic tradition,\" he said, referring to the first half of his book\u2019s title, \"Praying Like Monks.\" Prayer is the place where all denominations of the church \"have to, and can, unite,\" he said. \"We all pray to Jesus.\" God is our \"father, friend, comforter and advocate,\" said Pastor Staton, who encourages people to speak more honestly to God. (iStock) The second half of his book\u2019s title, \"Living Like Fools,\" comes from Staton\u2019s belief that if people \"spend time with Jesus, he will take you where he's going.\" Station also said, \"And he's always going beyond your comfort zone \u2026 He's going to the lost and the broken and the poor and the forgotten and the silenced and the marginalized.\" HOW DELICIOUS!

I'm opening myself up to hope.\" He continued, \"But the second way, and I would say the way God most often answers prayer \u2014 his preferred method \u2014 is to so reform the heart of the praying person that they participate in the answer to their own prayer.\" He added, \"It is to pray for the hungry until I find my own hand distributing bread, and to pray for that lost friend until I find myself in a conversation with them.\" JOEL OSTEEN ON OVERCOMING SETBACKS IN LIFE: TRUST IN A GOD OF \u2018SECOND CHANCES\u2019 If you begin to \"order your life\" through prayer, \"you're going to find yourself on adventures with Jesus that are wildly risky and incredibly rewarding.\" Tyler Staton wrote \"Praying Like Monks, Living Like Fools\" to encourage people to be honest in their communication with God through a routine of prayer. His new book was published last month and is a bestseller in the \"Christian Inspirational\" category on Amazon.

The Astros appeared in the Fall Classic in 2019 against the Washington Nationals and 2021 versus the Atlanta Braves, both resulting in losses. 'Mattress Mack': Houston Astros superfan has wagered $10 million to win $75 million if team wins World Series The team\u2019s 2017 victory came with a lot of questions and controversy. Following the win, Astros owner and chairman Jim Crane fired then-manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow after the MLB had suspended them both for a season without pay for a sign-stealing scandal. Major League Baseball found the club illegally created a system that decoded and communicated the opposing teams\u2019 pitching signs during their 2017 championship season. The team forfeited its regular first- and second-round picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts and paid a $5 million fine. The Astros kept their title \u2013 but, to many non-Houston fans, it remains shrouded in scandal.

The Giants\u2019 football product is much better, and the future appears to be bright. That does not mean there are any guarantees about what comes next for the Giants. They cannot in any way be discredited for the fine 6-2 record they took into their bye week , already exceeding many \u201cHow many games will they win?\u2019\u2019 predictions made at the start of the season. Actual points must supersede style points. View them as a soft 6-2, consider them an undeserving or deceptive 6-2 if you wish. The Giants are where they are because they navigated their way to victory six times in eight tries, and try telling the teams they\u2019ve beaten along the way that the losses the Giants pinned on them were not damaging or legitimate. Sure, it is an interesting statistical footnote that the Giants are the first team in NFL history to start 6-1 or better and have each of their first seven games decided by one possession. Neither team has reached 30 points in any Giants game this season \u2014 the only other team in the league in the first eight weeks that did not play a game with 30 points scored by either team is Green Bay. What that means is every game has been nearly the same for the Giants. Every game could have gone either way, and the Giants more often than not surged in the fourth quarter to finish the deal. That is commendable and also revelatory \u2014 which is why general manager Joe Schoen refused to part with any draft picks at the trade deadline to fill needs at wide receiver, inside linebacker and on the interior of the defensive line. Schoen did not allow the terrific record to alter his evaluation of the totality of his roster. The record says the Giants are far ahead of the timeline Schoen and coach Brian Daboll set in their heads for the jobs they were hired to do. Their eyes tell them something else. Daboll knows he is not a miracle worker and that he does not possess a secret formula to cajole his team across the finish line ahead of the competition. He also knows he is setting a framework for what he wants the Giants to be about, and that shredding expectations by winning games makes the growing pains far less painful. Schoen and Daboll did not know a thing about Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley \u2014 other than the biographical football stuff everyone else knows \u2014 and the first half of the season served to enhance the future for both players in Giants blue. Schoen and Daboll now know the quality of the character of both players, and their performances are making it difficult to consider 2023 without them. There are nine games remaining for both sides to figure out whether contracts will be extended to one, or to both. Jones has just four turnovers, and two of them \u2014 an interception on his final desperation pass in the Week 3 loss to the Cowboys and a no-big-deal fumble on the final play of the first half in the victory over the Ravens \u2014 were inconsequential. Jones has not been intercepted in 128 consecutive passes. Barkley, with 968 all-purpose yards, was second in the NFL to Tyreek Hill (982 yards) of the Dolphins. Barkley is on pace for 1,655 rushing yards and 2,057 all-purpose yards. Schoen\u2019s first draft class is paying dividends out of the gate. Each of the first eight picks has started at least one game. The first-rounders, outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux and right tackle Evan Neal, experienced typical rookie inconsistency, but both appear headed for big things. Are the 2022 Giants headed for big things? That\u2019s hard to say. They certainly set themselves up more robustly than anyone had a right to expect, based on the first half of their season. Daniel Jones cannot do it without this guy. Saquon Barkley cannot do it without this guy. There were questions when the Giants made Andrew Thomas the first offensive lineman off the board in the 2020 draft. Early in his rookie season, Thomas did not look like a premier left tackle. Take a look at him now, though . Try to find another player at the most important spot on the offensive line who is operating at a higher level. Thomas is the top-rated tackle in the league by Pro Football Focus \u2014 having allowed just one sack, one quarterback hit and nine pressures in 308 pass-block snaps. He has been on the field for all 538 snaps this season. This young man is going to become a very rich man sometime soon. Can we split the vote here? The ticket has to be Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney , in any order you prefer. Let\u2019s start with Toney, because he is no longer around (traded to the Chiefs). He played in fewer games (two) than he had hamstring injuries (three), and his body of work in 2022 for the Giants consisted of 35 snaps, two catches for zero yards, two rushes for 23 yards and a whole bunch of attitude. At least Golladay seems to care. In four games, the $72 million man has two receptions for 22 yards. He has been targeted six times in 99 snaps. Get open, will you! Can he? Tune in the second half of the season. Dexter Lawrence has been a solid player for three years, but he has never been this good. There was no expectation this 342-pounder would be leading the Giants in sacks, but there he is, with four of them. He had nine total sacks in his first three seasons. He is PFF\u2019s No. 5-graded interior defender, and his 26 total pressures shows he is more than just a run-stuffer. His workload is up because there is never a time the Giants want to take him out. \u201cIf you had a Rolls-Royce, wouldn\u2019t you want to drive it everywhere?\u2019\u2019 reasoned defensive coordinator Wink Martindale. General manager Joe Schoen likes the player who calls himself \u201cSexy Dexy\u2019\u2019 so much he picked up Lawrence\u2019s fifth-year option before the season even started. Lawrence, just 24, is in line for a lucrative extension. Cornerback Fabian Moreau deserves strong consideration in this category as well. For all the pressure Martindale sends, his unit has not exactly created the mayhem needed to truly disrupt a game. The Giants are 13th in the league in sacks with 15 and tied with the Seahawks for first with nine recovered fumbles. It is in the interception department where the Giants are lacking. They have only one, by Julian Love, and that does not cut it. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, that is the fewest interceptions by a Giants team through eight games since the NFL began recording statistics \u2026 in 1933. The Giants were down 20-13 in the season opener at Tennessee when Jones and Barkley went to work on a 12-play, 73-yard drive finished off by Jones\u2019 1-yard scoring pass to Chris Myarick with 1:09 remaining. Overtime beckoned. Wait, what is that? Head coach Brian Daboll is going for 2 and the win ? A failed conversion would have meant a 20-19 loss in his first game as a head coach. But Jones found Barkley, who made an outrageous cut to get into the end zone. The Giants had to sweat out a missed field goal as time ran out to beat the Titans, 21-20, and Daboll delivered a loud-and-clear message to his team and Giants fans: We\u2019re here to win. There is no doubt the Giants\u2019 offensive line is new and improved, but it looked old and rundown in Week 3 against the Cowboys. Jones was pressured on 27 of his 49 dropbacks and was sacked five times \u2014 three by DeMarcus Lawrence, who gave right tackle Evan Neal a rookie indoctrination. There was plenty of hype for the \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019\u2019 matchup of NFC East rivals. The Giants came in at 2-0, but exited at 2-1, mainly because they could not protect their quarterback in a 23-16 loss to the Cowboys. Is this really going to be a completely lost season for outside linebacker Azeez Ojulari? He missed the first three weeks of training camp with a strained hamstring then came up limping with a strained calf during post-practice conditioning running, forcing him out of the first two games. Ojulari played a total of 60 snaps in Weeks 3 and 4, and had one sack and one forced fumble. He hasn\u2019t played since because he hurt his other calf and is on injured reserve. That means he is not eligible to play until the Giants play the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in Week 12. Ojulari was supposed to be a bookend edge rusher with rookie Kayvon Thibodeaux, but it has not worked out that way. Can Ojulari salvage his 2022 season with a late contribution? After the season, what to do with Jones and Barkley \u2014 both impending free agents \u2014 are questions that reverberate around the entire organization. In the final nine games, the question is how much should and can the offense lean on Jones and Barkley? Jones is fourth in the NFL among quarterbacks with 64 rushing attempts and third in yards with 363. Jones using his legs is a key element of an offense that struggles to score and pass the ball down the field. How much, however, is too much? Barkley\u2019s 163 rushing attempts in eight games were second in the league to Derrick Henry (166), and Barkley is on pace for 346 rushes. He had 261 in his Offensive Rookie of the Year season in 2018. The Giants need everything they can get from these two, but must make sure they do not wear Jones and Barkley into the ground.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-30.203136444091797, -12.998684883117676]}, {"title": "Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor reveals stage 4 cancer diagnosis in band\u2019s Rock and Roll HOF speech", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/duran-duran-guitarist-andy-taylor-reveals-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis-in-bands-rock-and-roll-hof-speech/", "description": "Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor he is dying of cancer, his bandmates revealed during their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction speech on Saturday night", "content": "Founding Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor is suffering from stage 4 prostate cancer, his bandmates revealed during their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction speech on Saturday night Taylor, 61, was unable to attend the band\u2019s induction ceremony on Saturday night but frontman Simon Le Bon read a letter Taylor had written, in which he revealed that he was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer four years ago. \u201cMany families have experienced the slow burn of this disease and of course, we are no different,\u201d Taylor wrote in his letter. \u201cSo I speak from the perspective of a family man but with profound humility to the band, the greatest fans a group could have, and this exceptional accolade.\u201d The British rocker said he has been receiving excellent treatment, but had recently suffered a \u201csetback.\u201d He acknowledged that although his condition is \u201cnot immediately life-threatening, there is no cure.\u201d \u201cDespite the exceptional efforts of my team, I had to be honest in that both physically and mentally, I would be pushing my boundaries,\u201d the letter read. \u201cHowever, none of this needs to or should detract from what this band (with or without me) has achieved and sustained for 44 years.\u201d The induction ceremony was intended to be a reunion for Duran Duran, which Taylor was a member of from 1980 to 1986 and again from 2001 to 2006.

Together, Daniels and Kelly helped produce a scene of sheer rapture at Death Valley \u2014- something that was hard to envision when the two joined a program coming off consecutive non-winning seasons. Daniels ran for 25-yard touchdown in overtime and then found Mason Taylor for a do-or-die 2-point conversion, and 15th-ranked LSU seized control of the SEC West race with 32-31 victory over No. 6 Alabama on Saturday night. \u201cI had never beaten Alabama,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI was emotional, not for myself, but I was emotional for our team. Because I know what we looked like in January and to see where we are today, that\u2019s pretty emotional.\u201d Jubilant fans stormed the field after LSU (7-2, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) triumphed in a riveting game that included six second-half lead changes and a tying field goal by Alabama in the final 30 seconds. Alabama (7-2, 4-2) began overtime with the ball and took a 31-24 lead on Roydell Williams\u2019 second touchdown of the game.

It was a tough loss, but there\u2019s nobody that feels worse about it than the players.\u201d Kelly, who as Notre Dame\u2019s coach lost to Saban and Alabama twice in college football\u2019s postseason, became the coach to end LSU\u2019s decade-long run of home futility against the Tide at the beginning of a 10-year contract worth nearly $100 million. \u201cTo come here and restore the pride and tradition of this program just means so much,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt just feels so good to return the faith and trust that they\u2019ve given to me.\u201d Daniels passed for 182 yards and two touchdowns, and also ran for 95 yards and a score. Josh Williams had a 2-yard TD run for LSU. Alabama\u2019s Bryce Young passed for 328 yards and one touchdown, and also was intercepted. \u201cObviously, this isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but I am super proud of our team,\u201d Young said. \u201cThese are my brothers and this is tough.\u201d There were three lead changes in the final 4:44, starting when Young narrowly escaped a sack, scrambled right and found Ja\u2019Corey Brooks for a 41-yard touchdown. LSU went back in front 24-21 with 1:47 left in regulation when Daniels hit Taylor, a true freshman, in the back of the end zone for a 7-yard score. But Young drove Alabama to the LSU 28 and Will Reichard\u2019s 46-yard field goal with 21 seconds left tied it. Alabama took its first of two fourth-quarter leads with the help of face mask and defensive holding penalties by LSU that negated what would have been a third-down sack.

Today was one of those special moments.\" The loss ended a 14-game winning streak by the Tigers (8-1), the longest active streak among FBS teams. It was Clemson\u2019s fifth road loss since 2015.

(Michael Reaves/Getty Images) \"They just physically kicked our butt. Period. The end,\" Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. \"They absolutely dominated us in every aspect of football and it starts with coaching, tackling, blocking, you name it. It is what it is.\" Swinney said it was one of his most disappointing games in his 14 years as head coach. \"We gave up a score on offense, a score on special teams and a score on defense and that\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened since I was a head coach,\" he said \"We just got outcoached in every aspect of football. I wish I could say I saw it coming, but we had a great week of practice, a great week of preparation. But football\u2019s a crazy game.\" Irish players said it was fun celebrating with the fans. \"Our fans deserve this,\" Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer said. \"They deserve this win..\" Mayer had trouble hearing questions when the door to the press room opened because the crowd was so loud. \"They\u2019re crazy out there right now,\" Mayer said. Swinney pulled DJ Uiagalelei for a second straight game, even though he had completed 13 of 19 passes for 78 yards when he was replaced by Cade Klubnik late in the third quarter. This time it backfired, though, as Klubnik was pressured by Justin Ademilola and his pass was intercepted by Morrison at the 14-yard line. The Irish scored three plays later on Audric Estime\u2019s 2-yard run to make it 21-0. Uiagabele returned in the next series and drove the Tigers to the Irish 19-yard line before Morrison intercepted the pass to Joseph Ngata at the 4-yard line and returned it for a TD. With winds of 20 mph, and Drew Pyne struggling in recent games, the Irish leaned heavily on their run game, even though Clemson entered the game ranked seventh nationally against the run, giving up 87.9 yards a game. Logan Diggs rushed for 114 yards on 17 carries, Estime had 104 yards on 18 carries and the Irish compiled 263 yards rushing, the most rushing yards allowed by Clemson this season. The previous high was 206 yards by Florida State. \"They were clearly the more physical team. It\u2019s going to be a painful tape to watch for everybody,\" Swinney said. It was the second-highest rushing game for the Irish this season. The Irish improved to 5-0 when they rush for more than 200 yards.

(Michael Reaves/Getty Images) NO. 3 GEORGIA DOMINATES NO. 1 TENNESSEE; HENDON HOOKER SACKED SIX TIMES Pyne was 9 of 17 passing for 85 yards and added a 5-yard rushing touchdown. It was the fourth straight game that Pyne failed to complete more than 50% of his passes after completing 74% of his passes in his first three starts. Uiagalelei finished the game 27 of 39 yards for 191 yards. Clemson was held to 90 yards rushing. The Tigers avoided the shutout when Will Shipley, who ran for 63 yards on 12 carries, scored on a 1-yard run with 10:14 left in the game, and Uiagaalelei threw a 4-yard TD pass to Joseph Ngata with 1:35 left. The Irish added a 17-yard TD pass from Pyne to Mike Mayer with 4:16 left. The Irish dominated Clemson in the first half, rushing for 122 yards and amassing 163 yards overall while holding the Tigers to 30 yards rushing and 71 yards overall. But the big play was the Irish blocking their fourth punt in the past three games on Clemson\u2019s opening drive after the Tigers lost 11 yards after being called twice for holding. Linebacker Jordan Botelho broke through the line and got two hands on the punt and Kollie caught it and returned it 17 yards for a TD. The Irish opened a 14-0 lead 38 seconds before halftime when they drove 78 yards on 11 plays, with all but one of the plays being on runs. Estime had six runs for 35 yards, Chris Tyree had three runs for 17 yards and Pyne threw an 11-yard pass to Michael Mayer and ran twice, scoring on a 5-yard run. Tempers flared as the teams headed to the locker room at halftime after Clemson right guard Walker Parks pushed down Notre Dame defensive lineman Jayson Ademilola. Several players pushed before the teams were separated and headed to their separate tunnels. POLL IMPLICATIONS Clemson will likely drop out of the top 10 after losing to a three-loss team. The Irish, who beat then-No. 16 Syracuse 41-24 a week earlier, might receive some consideration.

After Jahmyr Gibbs\u2019 14-yard run to the 2, Williams barreled in to make it 15-14 after a failed 2-point conversion with 12:37 to go. LSU responded by driving inside the Alabama 15, but the Tide snuffed out Daniels\u2019 third-down keeper, limiting the Tigers to Damian Ramos\u2019 32-yard field goal with 6:52 to go. Alabama took its first lead on Will Reichard\u2019s third field goal of the game, concluding a third-quarter drive on which Alabama twice converted on fourth-and-short on runs by Williams. A crowd of about 102,000 turned Death Valley into \"Deaf Valley\" with ear-splitting roars that seemed to send vibrations coursing through the nearly century-old stadium.

The individuals had \u201cnowhere to go\u201d until a Home Office employee was alerted, and found the group emergency hotel accommodation. The group was made up of asylum-seekers who had been staying at Manston migrant processing center in Kent, southern England, a facility that charities and lawmakers say has become overcrowded and descended into dire and inhumane living conditions. According to the Home Office, officials were under the impression that the 11 individuals had accommodation arranged in London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was \u201cshameful\u201d they were abandoned in the center of the city, calling it \u201ca complete failure of duty and leadership.\u201d But the incident is emblematic of Britain\u2019s dramatically overwhelmed system for dealing with asylum-seekers and illegal migrants. The number of asylum claims processed in the UK has collapsed in recent years, leaving people in limbo for months and years \u2013 trapped in processing facilities or temporary hotels and unable to work \u2013 and fueling an intractable debate about Britain\u2019s borders. \u201cThe system is broken,\u201d Britain\u2019s Home Secretary Suella Braverman told Parliament on Monday \u2013 an inarguable but jarring admission after 12 years of Conservative rule, which has seen an unending line of ministers promising and failing to clamp down on illegal migration. Braverman blamed a rapid increase in small boat crossings across the English Channel, organized by people smugglers on mainland Europe. The beleaguered minister described the crossings in highly charged terms as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Britain\u2019s south coast. \u201cLet\u2019s stop pretending that they are all refugees in distress,\u201d she said. But the chaos facing migrants and asylum-seekers in the UK is also the result of a decade of political choices, with funding and action failing to match the heavy-handed rhetoric espoused by successive Conservative governments. \u201cIt\u2019s shambolic and it\u2019s cruel,\u201d Ben Ramanauskas, a research economist at Oxford University and an adviser to Liz Truss while the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade, told CNN about the country\u2019s system to deal with asylum-seekers. \u201cPart of that is due to the culture set by the Home Office, which views most immigrants with suspicion and treats them like potential criminals,\u201d Ramanauskas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply unfair and unjust system.\u201d The Home Office did not respond directly to that charge when approached by CNN, but said in a statement: \u201cThe number of people arriving in the UK who require accommodation has reached record levels and has put our asylum system under incredible strain.\u201d Another striking glimpse into the lives of migrants within Britain\u2019s processing facilities came flying over the fence from within the Manston facility this week. \u201cWe are in a difficult life now \u2026 we fill like we\u2019re in prison (sic),\u201d read a letter, apparently written by a young girl and stuffed inside a bottle that was then thrown towards assembled journalists. \u201cSome of us very sick \u2026 ther\u2019s some women\u2019s that are pregnant they don\u2019t do anything for them (sic) \u2026 We really need your help. Please help us,\u201d the letter reads. The situation at the asylum-processing center is a \u201cbreach of humane conditions,\u201d Conservative lawmaker Roger Gale told Sky News Monday, as dozens of charities wrote to the prime minister to raise concerns over \u201covercrowding.\u201d The facility is currently holding around 4,000 people, among them women and children, despite being intended to only hold 1,500, Gale said. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick later told Sky News that some people at the center were \u201csleeping on the floor.\u201d He claimed the \u201croot cause of what we\u2019re seeing at Manston is not the government,\u201d but the growing number of migrants traveling across the Channel onto England\u2019s shores. Those numbers have shot up in recent years. 38,000 people have arrived in the UK by small boat this year, up from 28,000 last year and less than 2,000 in 2019, according to Home Office data. The crossings are a relatively new phenomenon, which emerged after thousands of migrants hoping to cross into England spent months and years in the so-called Calais \u201cjungle,\u201d a sprawling settlement on the northern coast of France guarded by French and British border officers. \u201cIn late 2018, a couple of boats successfully navigated the channel,\u201d giving rise to a small \u201ccottage industry\u201d of smugglers, Rob McNeil, the deputy director of the Migration Observatory, told CNN. \u201cNot only did it work, but because it was a very visible spectacle it became very prominent in the British public discourse. It was front page news,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it became visible to other people that this was a successful technique. \u201cInstead of having a bottleneck at Calais, you suddenly had a showerhead (with) multiple little nozzles across the French coast\u201d from which people could launch dangerous journeys in dinghies and small vessels, McNeil said. \u201cThat\u2019s much harder to police.\u201d Warnings grow of dire conditions at migrant processing center in England The number of arrivals in the UK remains relatively low compared to EU member states; last year Britain ranked fourth in total asylum applications and 19th in per capita claims among European countries, according to the Migration Observatory. But while the government has pointed the finger at increased crossings for overrunning the country\u2019s asylum network, it has done little to reduce their impact on the UK \u2013 and a litany of ministerial decisions have made disruption worse for Britons and migrants alike. The speed at which asylum claims are processed has slumped remarkably in recent years. 87% of claims received an initial decision within six months in the second quarter of 2014, according to the Migration Observatory , but seven years later that figure was just 6%. The fall comes after the government scrapped its six-month target in mid-2019. It means migrants are being housed in temporary accommodation and hotels while waiting to hear news on their claim, a policy at which Braverman has repeatedly lashed out. A Home Office spokesperson told CNN there are currently more than 37,000 asylum-seekers in hotels, costing the UK taxpayer \u00a35.6 million ($6.35 millon) a day. Many migration experts point the finger for that bill squarely back at the government. \u201cThe Home Office has clearly made decisions about allocation of resources which have impacted on processing speeds,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cIf (asylum-seekers\u2019) claims were processed more quickly and more efficiently, then the system would not be snarled up in the way that it is and the human experience of these people would be less unpleasant, while at the same time the costs to the taxpayer would be considerably lower,\u201d he added. \u201cThis issue has not benefited anybody. It is important this asylum backlog is addressed as a matter of some urgency, if the government wants to take charge of the situation.\u201d To date, the government\u2019s policy \u2013 a deal to deport some migrants to Rwanda \u2013 has been bogged down in legal appeals and failed to transport a single person in the seven months since it was announced. \u201cIt clearly isn\u2019t working (and) it hasn\u2019t acted as a deterrent in any way\u201d to other asylum-seekers, Ramanauskas said. Surrounding the Rwanda plan has been a continued swirl of provocative language on illegal migration, which the government argues underpins a strong stance but critics say is divisive and cruel towards those escaping war, instability or persecution. \u201cWhat the government has done through its rhetoric over the past years is try to merge in people\u2019s minds asylum seekers and illegal immigrants,\u201d as part of a \u201cquite conscious attempt to suggest all asylum seekers are inherently illegal,\u201d Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the Conservative Party, told CNN. But there are at least partial solutions to the UK\u2019s seemingly intractable illegal migration crisis, experts believe. As well as prioritizing the processing of claims by boosting funding and creating new centers around the country, Britain could ditch a rule that asylum applications must be made on UK soil \u2013 allowing people to apply at embassies before they complete a lengthy journey through Europe and across the Channel. And a current rule that bars asylum-seekers from working for one year should be loosened to help people provide for themselves and contribute to the economy, critics say. \u201cIt\u2019s madness: You\u2019re keeping people in poverty, which leads to crime \u2013 they don\u2019t have anything to do to spend their time, which is not good for them and bad for local communities,\u201d Ramanauskas said. Sweden, Canada and Australia are among countries that allow asylum-seekers to work immediately, while in the United States, the wait is six months. For all of the heavy-handed rhetoric of successive Conservative governments, a political calculation is also at play. \u201cIt\u2019s never done the Conservative Party any harm, since the beginning of the 1960s, to have immigration on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Bale said. During its 12 years in power \u2013 a period largely dominated by Brexit and claims by its supporters that the UK could \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders \u2013 the Conservatives have repeatedly sought to paint the opposition Labour Party as \u201cremainers\u201d who would be soft on migration. That imperative means solving Britain\u2019s illegal migration conundrum may not yield the political dividends the party is looking for \u2013 particularly as it struggles to get a handle on Britain\u2019s economic crisis. \u201cIf you can\u2019t deliver to people in their pocket, then this is a useful distraction,\u201d Bale said. Rishi Sunak: The super-rich former banker who became the first person of color to lead Britain Still, even on traditionally fruitful domain, it remains increasingly possible the Conservative Party will run out of road. \u201cThere\u2019s always a trade-off between it being in the news and voters beginning to think the government\u2019s lost control,\u201d Bale said. Opinion polls suggest voters are losing faith in the Conservatives to tackle the issue of immigration \u2013 a trend which, in the past, has left the party battling to fend off criticism from insurgent right-wing parties that it hasn\u2019t done enough to reduce arrivals. That\u2019s the dynamic facing Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister, who has readily embraced the Rwanda plan and spent much of his early political capital defending his Home Secretary, Braverman, as she decries the UK\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d asylum system. After 12 years of harsh words, and as the human impact on asylum-seekers in Britain begins to seep out of facilities like Manston, Sunak risks quickly losing the trust of Britons on all sides of the migration debate. \u201cYou have got to the point where people are entitled to ask \u2026 if it is broken, who broke it?\u201d Bale said.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "cnn", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [7.209607124328613, 1.1563923358917236]}, {"title": "Astros are best MLB team in this era \u2014 like it or not", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/astros-are-best-mlb-team-in-this-era-like-it-or-not/", "description": "OK, let\u2019s deal with the Astros\u2019 legacy.

Because they didn\u2019t shrink after punishment and embarrassment following their illegal sign stealing in 2017. They didn\u2019t go away. Nope, they kept absorbing the boos, the criticism and the wonder about their achievements. Mostly they just kept returning to the postseason, the reformed criminal that proved able to succeed by playing it straight up . Even if you want to eliminate the 2017 season, and act as if the Astros\u2019 first championship didn\u2019t happen, that\u2019s fine. They are still the team of this era. Still the standard. Nobody in recent years has been as consistently excellent as the Astros. They have lost Carlos Correa, George Springer, Gerrit Cole and their architect, Jeff Luhnow. But no matter what they\u2019ve lost, they just keep winning. And now they have won it all. It will not stop all the barbs, but I return to the words offered by starter Lance McCullers, one of five players remaining from the 2017 squad, who said before this 118th World Series: \u201cWe put ourselves in that position and it doesn\u2019t matter if it [sign stealing] was more widespread than maybe it seems to have come to be, but we put ourselves in that position and we have to wear it on the chin. People are going to have the right to feel how they want to feel and all we can do is try to win ballgames and continuously win and eventually I think people will just throw their hands up and be like, \u2018They\u2019re kind of probably good.\u2019 \u201d They\u2019re kind of probably great. Six straight ALCS appearances. Four pennants in that time. And now a second title that comes with no echoes of trash cans. Just an Astros team that is excellent at everything \u2014 notably stick-to-itiveness. Toughness. Relentlessness. Not to mention hitting, fielding, developing players and pitching. Lots and lots of pitching. Justin Verlander, another 2017 holdover, is probably going to win his third AL Cy Young. But in the playoffs, the Astros\u2019 co-aces were young Cristian Javier and Framber Valdez. Think about that. On Saturday night, a Valdez was special for the second time in this series, holding the Phillies to one run in six innings. Yordan Alvarez \u2014 like Javier and Valdez, a star who arrived after 2017 \u2014 hit a three-run homer that traveled 450 feet and into history as the key blow in a 4-1 Game 6 victory that eliminated the dogged, but ultimately overmatched, Phillies. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a really dominant stretch,\u201d McCullers said a week ago. \u201cAnd so I think a World Series title would help kind of solidify us as a team that could go up against other great teams of other generations.\u201d Mission accomplished. For that. And for helping manager Dusty Baker finally get his ring. Baker replaced A.J. Hinch, the manager in 2017, and brought calmness and likeability to a group that needed both. Baker\u2019s reward was to remove the stain from an otherwise brilliant managing ledger. He had been the manager with the most regular-season wins (2,093) without a championship. He had, before Saturday night, a 9-16 record in potential clinching games in the postseason. This time, his Astros clinched, and Baker\u2019s odyssey to becoming a World Series-winning manager was over. He listened to a crowd of nearly 43,000 persistently return to, \u201cWe want Houston,\u201d a mocking chant of Yankees fans who asked for it. The Yankees have never forgotten or forgiven the Astros for eliminating them in 2017. But as is the Astros\u2019 DNA now, they just keep proving their worth, eliminating the Yankees in the 2019 ALCS and sweeping them this year for the AL pennant. For about half the game Saturday, the Phillies appeared as if they might force a Game 7. Zack Wheeler, with an extra day\u2019s rest, regained his best fastball and shut out the Astros for five innings. Kyle Schwarber hit just the second lefty-on-lefty homer versus Valdez this season, a leadoff shot in the sixth that made it 1-0. But aside from Game 3, when they led throughout to take a 2-1 series lead, the Phillies were unable to stay ahead of the Astros. Of the other 45 innings played in this series \u2014 Houston led in all but one. And it was not the sixth inning Saturday. No. 9 hitter Martin Maldonado was hit by a pitch and rookie star Jeremy Pe\u00f1a singled with one out. Phillies manager Rob Thomson decided to go for his own lefty-lefty stalwart, reliever Jose Alvarado, to face Alvarez. Alvarado had allowed just one homer to a lefty this year. And Alvarez, since hitting a go-ahead homer for a second straight day in Game 2 of the ALDS versus the Mariners, had gone 5-for-42 without a homer. But this time, he crushed a 99-mph fastball a sent it above the hedges in center field. It was 3-1, soon to be 4-1 before the inning ended. And with the dominance of the Astros\u2019 bullpen (none of the relievers part of the 2017 club), the series was over. Astros relievers yielded five runs in 54 \u00b9/\u2083 innings this postseason \u2014 during which their starters were terrific, their fielding exquisite and their hitting not as overpowering as in the past, but consistent enough. If you hate the Astros for what they did in 2017, they will never receive your pardon. Got it. But the trash-can banging stopped \u2014 the winning never did. The production of good players, notably arms, hasn\u2019t stopped. The winning of big games continued. There is another championship now, one that screams about who they are \u2014 like it or not.

It was only a matter of time Saturday: these Astros were going to win the World Series. Mission accomplished, Houston. Minute Maid Park became the scene of an orange alert with the Astros\u2019 4-1 victory over the Phillies in Game 6 of the World Series. The Astros celebrated a second world championship in six seasons, leaving the Phillies to contemplate an unexpected run (at least by fans) through the postseason that ended two victories short of the ultimate prize. The World Series title was Dusty Baker\u2019s first throughout his celebrated managerial career, removing the 73-year-old from the list of best managers/head coaches to have never won a title. With a sellout crowd of 42,958 chanting \u201cWe want Houston\u201d at various points \u2013 a shot at Yankees fans who had chanted the same before the ALCS \u2013 the Astros closed the series with a third straight victory. In the end, the Astros\u2019 pitching was too much for the Phillies, who were held to three runs over the final three games after erupting for five homers in Game 3. This one tilted in the Astros\u2019 direction in the sixth on Yordan Alvarez\u2019s monstrous three-run homer that gave the Astros a 3-1 lead. Phillies manager Rob Thomson had removed Zack Wheeler and summoned left-hander Jose Alvarado to face Alvarez, who crushed a 99-mph fastball over the center-field fence. The rally started with Martin Maldonado drilled by a pitch before Jeremy Pena delivered a single with one out. Alvarez, who blasted 37 homers in the regular season, hadn\u2019t left the yard in the postseason until his bomb against Alvarado. Alex Bregman followed with a walk and reached second on a wild pitch before Christian Vazquez\u2019s RBI single extended the Astros\u2019 lead to 4-1. Wheeler lasted 5 1/3 innings and allowed two earned runs on three hits with one walk and one hit batsman. The right-hander was removed after 70 pitches. Kyle Schwarber homered leading off the sixth to break the scoreless deadlock. The blast was Schwarber\u2019s sixth this postseason, tying him for the Phillies\u2019 lead with Bryce Harper. Framber Valdez left a 2-2 fastball over the plate that Schwarber crushed into the right-field seats. Valdez was removed after the sixth inning with the Astros ahead 2-1. The left-hander, in a second dominant start in this series, allowed only two hits and struck out nine with two walks. Wheeler, pitching on six days\u2019 rest, saw the return of his velocity \u2013 it had dipped in his last start \u2013 and rolled through the early innings. Kyle Tucker walked in the second to complete a 10-pitch plate appearance, but Wheeler got Christian Vazquez to hit into an inning-ending double play. Trey Mancini singled leading off the third, but Wheeler got the next three outs. Jeremy Pena\u2019s single leading off the fourth also preceded three straight outs. In his Game 2 start, Wheeler scuffled through five innings in which he allowed five runs, four of which were earned. It led to Thomson giving Wheeler the extra rest, surmising the right-hander was feeling the effects of building up too quickly in September after the forearm inflammation that forced him to the injured list subsided. The Phillies had their best early shot against Valdez in the second inning when Alec Bohm singled and Matt Vierling drew a two-out walk. But Valdez retired Edmundo Sosa to escape.

He seemed to be on his way back last week when he participated in practice, but he left the ice early after suffering a setback. Rangers coach Gerard Gallant was not as committal as Chytil with regard to playing tomorrow. The coach sounded optimistic, however, saying Chytil looked good in practice. \u201cHe\u2019s a huge part of our team,\u201d Gallant said. \u201cFil\u2019s a big part of our group, and we really miss him when he\u2019s out, so obviously it makes a big difference in your top nine for sure.\u201d After breaking out during the Rangers\u2019 playoff run last season, Chytil started the season well with two goals and an assist in his first six games.

So confident they will take the majority in the House and probably the Senate in Tuesday\u2019s midterms, key members have been quietly plotting how to make life difficult for the Biden administration, particularly on its radicalized economic agenda. Sure, even in the best-case scenario (winning both chambers), Republicans will face long odds pushing through new legislation. They still need President Biden\u2019s signature and will likely lack a \u00adveto-proof majority in the Senate. Yet people who have spoken to GOP leadership tell me plans are taking shape to attack economic policy enacted while Biden and the Dems enjoyed a majority in Congress for two long and disastrous years. Again, nothing revolutionary, but Republicans feel they can shape the debate. Put bills on Sleepy Joe\u2019s desk demanding he end his war on domestic oil production, which has helped fuel massive inflation, and others to loosen his anti-business regulatory agenda that has stymied growth as the economy falls into recession. They will block lefty nominees to key Cabinet and regulatory posts that need Senate approval (bye-bye to far-left telecom lawyer Gigi Sohn at the FCC), and wield Congress\u2019s power of the purse (no more stimulus checks or tax increases) to reduce spending and spur some growth. Then Republicans will turn to another regulatory agency: The Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler, a former Wall Street banker and academic, is the chair of the agency, appointed by Sleepy Joe nearly two years ago supposedly to protect investors from scammers. Instead, Gensler is transforming the SEC in ways not even moderate Dems on Wall Street had ever imagined. He\u2019s launched an all-out war against the crypto industry that is stifling innovation because developers don\u2019t know if their digital coins associated with block-chain technology will result in an SEC lawsuit. He wants to remake the structure of the stock market that appears to be working just fine because progressives think Wall Street is making too much money. And that\u2019s probably not the worst of it. He and his Dem colleagues on the commission approved a cockamamie set of standards imposed by the Nasdaq stock market that is intended to make every listed company disclose and meet progressive board-diversity mandates . (Noticeably exempted: All those Chinese companies listed on the exchange as Nasdaq slipped in a loophole where they can skip appointing members of the country\u2019s oppressed ethnic minorities.) Now he wants to make the Nasdaq model de rigueur across corporate America. In documents to investors, Gensler wants public companies to make sweeping disclosures on how they are reducing their carbon footprint, on top of revealing the racial and ethnic makeup of their workforce. Its questionable how any of this gets to the SEC\u2019s core mission of protecting investors, or leads to better-run companies. But with Dems in charge, Gensler is full steam ahead as he seeks to kiss up to progressives, including his patron, lefty Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Gensler is angling to be Treasury secretary when the current occupant, Janet Yellen steps down as expected next year. A Republican congressional sweep \u00adnegates the Gensler Treasury possibility, I am told. The Senate will hold hearings on what the GOP believes is his radical transformation of the agency. He and his deputies will face scrutiny by the House Financial Services Committee that would be run by North Carolina Republican Patrick McHen\u00adry, as well as questioning by subcommittees. By keeping Gensler and his lackeys on the Hill, they will have less time to muck up the markets. In the Senate, plans are also in place to put so-called riders on must-pass spending bills to zero out Gensler\u2019s ESG/diversity stuff . Biden will have a choice of either agreeing to the partial defunding of SEC activities and signing spending bills, or face a legislative stalemate. Another set of hearings will target the corporate enablers of the Dems\u2019 progressive economic agenda. Retiring Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey has been requesting information from companies involved in Environmental Social Governance investing, which is a big moneymaker on Wall Street but, he believes, anti-consumer and politically fraught. Toomey and top Republicans believe this investment method has forced companies to adopt progressive positions on the environment and other contentious issues at the worst possible time. By late 2021, inflation and gas prices in particular were already spiking because of Biden\u2019s anti-drilling energy agenda while pandemic lockdowns ended. The subsequent war in Ukraine further eroded oil inventories and added more price pressure. Asset managers pushing ESG mandates made a bad situation exponentially worse by threatening to direct money away from energy producers that didn\u2019t further cut back production. Once in the majority, Republicans will have subpoena power over massive asset managers, and to compel Wall Street firms to turn over the information and defend their practices at public hearings \u2014 which I am told is the plan. Of course, all bets are off if the GOP loses Tuesday. the task of squeezing Biden\u2019s leftward lurch on the economy becomes more difficult if the GOP takes just the House.

Bills star Stefon Diggs was a receiver many people pointed to as someone Wilson reminded them of. The Jets selected Wilson with the 10th-overall pick in April, and he has already had two 100-yard receiving games. Wilson said he respects Diggs, but did not think they played with a similar style. \u201cDiggs is a great receiver, really fun to watch and plays with a lot of energy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cPersonally, I like to take something from everyone\u2019s game. I feel like Diggs is a really good player, and anytime you see another good receiver out there, you want to take things, add it to your game, make yourself better. Personally, I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re as similar as most may think. He\u2019s a great player. He does everything well. The more I can get myself on the level, it would be all right.\u201d The comparison comes from the size of the two players. Diggs is 6-foot and 191 pounds. Wilson is 6-foot and 192 pounds. The Jets can only hope Wilson will have the type of impact Diggs has had for the Bills. Diggs will enter the game Sunday with 55 catches for 764 yards and seven touchdowns. Wilson has 34 catches for 429 yards and two touchdowns. He had six catches for 115 yards last week in the Jets\u2019 loss to the Patriots. Wilson actually grew up idolizing another Bills wide receiver \u2014 Stevie Johnson. \u201cI love Stevie,\u201d Wilson said. Wilson often mentions Johnson when he is asked who he has modeled his game after. Johnson is an unusual choice because he is not an all-time great. Johnson played eight seasons, six for the Bills. He had three 1,000-yard receiving seasons. So why Johnson? \u201cIt\u2019s just me being a lover of football since I was 5 years old and wanting to learn about the game and always paying attention to everyone,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI feel like growing up I watched every football game. I feel like I watched every game that ever came on for like 10 years in my life. \u201cStevie Johnson was one of those dudes that always stuck out to me, always open. He wasn\u2019t always in the best situation, though. That was just the thing that held him back or maybe he is up in those ranks. For me, as far as skill and the way he got off the ball and got into his routes, it was fun for me to watch as a young kid.\u201d RB James Robinson was added to the injury report on Saturday with a knee injury. He is listed as questionable for Sunday\u2019s game. The Jaguars said Robinson had knee soreness after his last game with them before he was traded to the Jets.

Known as Tippity Wichity Island \u2014 a 90-minute drive from Washington D.C. \u2014 the 5-acre enclave is known for its shady, yet colorful past. The current owners, Gail and John Harmon, told Insider they believed the island served as a brothel after the Civil War and was operated by a soldier named Capt. Henry Howgate. Records show Howgate was one of the first residents of Tippity Wichity Island, according to the listing from Sotheby\u2019s . The listing adds Howgate purchased it in 1879. Howgate had a lengthy rap sheet, which included convictions for fraud and embezzlement, according to an article published in 1895 by The News. Meanwhile, the Harmons purchased the island as a timeshare in the 1970s for $125,000, when they and another couple saw an ad in the classified section of a local newspaper, the Washingtonian. The Harmons had been on the hunt for a vacation home by the water when they moved to Washington for a military commitment at the time, they said. The ad caught their eye, which included a quote from William Shakespeare\u2019s play, \u201cRichard II,\u201d that read: \u201cThis other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress built by Nature for herself.\u201d \u201c[We] were blown away by how wonderful it was,\u201d Gail Harmon said of the first time they visited the island. For 30 years, the two couples alternated weekends \u2014 until the other pair decided to sell their share to the Harmons nearly a decade ago, they told Insider. Before its use as a vacation retreat, it had an entirely different purpose. Passing Tippity Wichity Island on a Potomac River cruise in 2017, Jody Argo Schroath, an editor of Chesapeake Bay Magazine , reported how locals believed the name suggests a bordello was built on the island after the Civil War. \u201cIt\u2019s a corruption of the name \u2018Tippling and Witchery Island,\u2019 named for a house of ill-repute located there following the Civil War,\u201d Schroath wrote in the column. Meanwhile, a friend told Gail that the island could have also served as an illegal distillery during the Prohibition Area in the 1920s. The friend revealed that their father would import casks of whiskey to the island during that period. \u201cIt was a perfect place to meet your purchasers,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the federal government came up the river, you could go roll off the back.\u201d A five-minute boat ride from the mainland, and with an electric system that holds a backup generator, the island could also serve as a full-time residence. The package includes a three-bedroom cottage with an open-plan living and dining room, as well as a wood-burning stove. Other features include a dock, a beach, a launch area for kayaks and canoes, and a heated outdoor swimming pool. \u201cWashington, D.C., was still a small outpost in the 1800s,\u201d David DeSantis, the broker on the listing, told Insider. \u201cIt was the wilderness. There was a lot of piracy on the water, it was sort of a lawless environment.\u201d \u201cBy current standards of what people think of in the US as beachfront summer homes, this is still pretty modest,\u201d DeSantis added. \u201cBut it\u2019s got a lot of charm. The house is more like an \u2018expanded cottage.\u2019 It\u2019s not like living in a mansion on an island. You could turn it into that if you wanted to but that\u2019s not their vibe.\u201d As the Harmons are nearing 80, they said age played a factor in their decision to finally sell their beloved island. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d Gail said.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [3.902315378189087, 2.8151097297668457]}, {"title": "\u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 Live Stream: Time, Channel, How To Watch Ravens vs. Saints Live Online", "link": "https://decider.com/2022/11/07/monday-night-football-live-stream-ravens-saints-stream-manningcast-schedule/", "description": "Can the Ravens make it three in a row?", "content": "Live from the Caesars Superdome, the New Orleans Saints host the Baltimore Ravens on Monday Night Football !

Lamar Jackson and the Ravens hit the road to play the New Orleans Saints as Week 9 wraps up from the Big Easy. Get the free Action Network app for expert picks, live odds, bet tracking and more. Baltimore enters tonight\u2019s matchup as a 2.5-point road favorite according to most sportsbooks. That seems like a reasonable spread since the Ravens are 5-3, but the Saints should be a tough out despite being 3-5. Jackson is clearly the best quarterback in this game and has already has 15 touchdown passes, which was fourth-best in the NFL entering week 9. The former MVP also leads Baltimore with 553 rushing yards and two touchdowns. If star tight end Mark Andrews can\u2019t play in this game, the Ravens might need Jackson to make some magic happen with his legs at some point tonight. The Saints have looked like a different team with Andy Dalton at quarterback. Dalton took over in Week 4 following an injury to Jameis Winston, and since then New Orleans is averaging 29.6 points per game. It\u2019s also important to note that Saints wide receiver Mike Thomas was put on injured reserve Thursday due to a foot injury. Thomas had 171 yards and three touchdowns this season but has not played since Week 3.

Some mornings there\u2019s a stack of pancakes and sizzling bacon to pair with your first cup of coffee. Some mornings there\u2019s so little rush-hour traffic you have to check and make sure you moved your watch back an hour. Some mornings, all your meetings are canceled until after lunch. Monday was a good morning for those in the employ of the New York Jets football club . This is what they saw when they snapped open the newspaper and looked at the standings in the AFC East: W-L Pct. Buffalo 6-2, .750 N.Y. Jets 6-3, .667 Miami 6-3, .667 New England 5-4, .556 Yes. This was a good morning. It was good to take a snapshot of that. The Jets, from top to bottom, have insisted for weeks that nothing they do surprises them nearly as much as it surprises anyone \u2014 or everyone \u2014 else. Part of the reason they\u2019ve been able to win six of those nine heading into the bye is because of that very belief, that innate confidence, the swagger they\u2019re not at all too shy to show off. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun,\u201d Jets coach Robert Saleh said Monday afternoon, maybe 23 hours after his team had secured the most impressive victory of his 26-game tenure, a 20-17 beating of the Bills Sunday at MetLife Stadium . \u201cEven the most optimistic Jets fan wouldn\u2019t have had us at 6-3.\u201d There are reasons for that, and some even go beyond the innate defense mechanism of so many Jets fans to close their eyes and wait for the other cleat to drop. That is a mystical pessimism earned over decades of Mud Bowls and roughing-the-quarterback-on-second-and-18, butt fumbles and field-goal doinks and fake spikes and blown-out Achilles tendons. But there\u2019s something beyond that dark-cloud nihilism: the Jets\u2019 history isn\u2019t just colorful and star-crossed, it\u2019s also been overloaded with lots of bad football, and not just in recent years. Consider that in 63 years of business, the Jets have made the playoffs just 14 times. Consider that in 63 years of business, the Jets have been 6-3 or better nine weeks into a season just 16 times, including right now. Think about that for a second: 6-3 isn\u2019t 8-1 or 9-0. Six-and-three guarantees you nothing but the chance to maybe enjoy meaningful football games past Thanksgiving. Sixteen times in 63 seasons? The Patriots have been 6-3 16 times since 2003! \u201cWe\u2019re too young to be jaded,\u201d Saleh said. And in truth, that might be the most dead-on-prescient thing a Jets coach has said since Sept. 23, 1965, when Weeb Ewbank said, \u201cJoe Namath will be our starter this week and hopefully for many weeks to come\u201d a few days before the third game of the 1965 season. This isn\u2019t simply about culture change; every freshly hired coach and GM in the last 15 years drags that tired old word into their opening press conference (apparently it\u2019s a law) and that brand-new culture works wonderfully until it doesn\u2019t, until losses pile up and bury culture in the sand like the Statue of Liberty in \u201cPlanet of the Apes.\u201d This is about fresh blood. The Jets have been celebrated for going with such a heavy youth movement, especially so because so many of the kids have already started delivering in big ways . For years, newly acquired Jets have scoffed that they carry any burdens of past franchise foibles but the truth is when they\u2019re vets and have been in the league a few years \u2014 well, let\u2019s face it, they\u2019ve had their share of laughs at the Jets\u2019 expense, too. They may not have been a part of it, but they knew of it. These Jets? Think about the look your kids give you when you definitively tell them, \u201cThe Beatles were the best rock-and-roll band of all time,\u201d and they haven\u2019t the slightest idea what you\u2019re talking about. Or ask them about that \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d reference from three paragraphs ago. That\u2019s what \u201csame old Jets\u201d means to this group. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d said one of those kids, quarterback Zach Wilson, \u201cand such a cool challenge to go out and compete and get the win, understanding that we have something special.\u201d Maybe this all has a genuine shelf life, starting with the trip to Foxborough in 12 days. Only nine of the first 15 Jets teams to start 6-3 or better actually made the playoffs, after all, so that\u2019s hardly a guarantee of anything. Or maybe the final eight games include enough dates with the Bears and Lions and Jaguars and a few more surprises against other teams that they can keep spreading their message until deep into the holiday season. If so, there will be plenty of good mornings ahead.

The reel is set to dramatic music, and shows a variety of footage from Turner\u2019s time with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Additionally, Hamm provides commentary regarding why potential suitors should sign the versatile shortstop. \u201cHe can run. He can throw. He plays elite shortstop. He hits. He hits for power,\u201d Hamm says. \u201cHe can lead off and be a table-setter, or he can hit second or third and be a run producer.\u201d Hamm also provides stats that illustrate the kind of player the 29-year-old Turner has been over the past few seasons. \u201cSince 2019 he\u2019s been the second best position player in baseball according to fangraphs with a 20.1 fWAR,\u201d Hamm says. \u201cTrea\u2019s the only active shortstop with a lifetime career .300 plus batting average. The last shortstop to finish his career with a .300 average was Derek Jeter,\u201d Hamm later adds. The sizzle reel also highlights Turner\u2019s sleek style of play and compares it to the approaches perfected by Stephen Curry and Jerry Rice in their respective sports. According to The Post\u2019s Jon Heyman , the Dodgers, Phillies, Cardinals, Red Sox, Cubs and Braves could all be interested in Turner\u2019s services and could net a contract in the nine-year, $275 million range. Turner was effective for the Dodgers in 2022. He finished the season with a .298 batting average as well as 21 home runs. Turner has shown no sign of slowing down as he approaches free agency. He is part of a strong shortstop free agency group that also includes Carlos Correa and Dansby Swanson. \u201cYou have the opportunity to change the direction of your franchise with a centerpiece, a player that gives you a chance to win every day with him at the top of your lineup,\u201d Hamm says. \u201cFocus now because the opportunity will pass you by in a flash.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-18.219621658325195, -18.17736053466797]}, {"title": "Ted Cruz booed, hit with beer can during Astros World Series parade", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/ted-cruz-booed-hit-with-beer-can-during-astros-world-series-parade/", "description": "Cruz (R-Texas) rode atop a military Humvee with his family during the parade through the city celebrating the Astros\u2019 second World Series win in six years when he was hit by the cacophony of jeers, some one-finger salutes, and what appeared to be a full can of beer.", "content": "It\u2019s not just a Bronx thing.

Fetterman has said he actually wants to \"fund\" the police and that \"they\u2019re the most important tool to make the street safer.\" But on Saturday, he and former President Barack Obama campaigned with Democratic U.S. House candidate Summer Lee , who has advocated for defunding the police and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

John would often patrol with officers and helped bring grants to Braddock to fund police needs, including surveillance cameras.\" \"John\u2019s record has earned him the endorsement of the Guardian Civic League, the organization that represents the Philadelphia Police Department's Black officers, and leaders like Montgomery County Sheriff Sean Kilkenny,\" Calvello continued. \"It's Dr. Oz who opposed the American Rescue Plan that provided hundreds of millions in public safety funding across PA and prevented cuts to law enforcement services, and who now supports the radical Rick Scott Plan that would hollow out federal law enforcement and defund federal aid to local police,\" he said.

His status is uncertain for the team's game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. \"We're just going through it, still evaluating it, and we'll see where it goes,\" coach Sean McDermott said Monday. \"I'll know more in the next 24 hours and then probably be able to check in with [the media] back on Wednesday.\" Allen suffered the injury during the last drive of the team's 20-17 loss to the New York Jets. Jets defensive lineman Bryce Huff got past backup right tackle David Quessenberry, in for injured tackle Spencer Brown, and hit Allen's throwing arm, which resulted in a strip sack recovered by Buffalo. The quarterback threw a low pass that looked off-target to wide receiver Stefon Diggs on the following play and then was seen holding his right elbow and trying to shake out the arm. \"There's some slight pain,\" Allen said after the game. \"But we'll get through it.\" On the final Bills offensive play of the game, Allen threw a pass 69.3 yards in the air, per NFL NextGen Stats, intended for wide receiver Gabe Davis. It was the longest pass attempt of the past six seasons, per NextGen stats. He finished the game completing 18-of-34 passes (52.9%) for 205 yards with two interceptions. All five of the Jets' sacks came against four or fewer pass-rushers, which is a career high for the quarterback. Allen did finish as the game's leader on the ground with nine carries for 86 yards and two scores, including a career-long 36-yard touchdown. Case Keenum is the Bills' backup quarterback. If Allen is unable to go, Keenum would face the Vikings, one of his former teams, alongside Diggs, the receiver who caught the \"Minneapolis Miracle\" reception from him. Allen has not missed a regular-season game since his rookie year, when he also had a UCL injury in his right elbow, which caused him to sit out four games. \"We all know Josh and how competitive he is, and he loves to compete, loves to be out there with his teammates,\" McDermott said. \"So, you know, I would never count him out. That's the one thing I do know about him is that right now, the medical piece, we're still evaluating it.

MSNBC is under fire for firing Tiffany Cross as the network\u2019s biggest stars have taken heat from former colleague Keith Olbermann for not defending the now-former \"Cross Connection\" host. MSNBC dumped the contentious weekend host on Friday, declining to renew her contract after two controversial years that resulted in Cross causing a variety of headaches for MSNBC executives. A source close to the situation told Fox News Digital that Cross showed \"repeated bad behavior on and off-air,\" including over-the-top rhetoric. Conservatives and Republicans were the target of the majority of Cross\u2019 disparaging comments , but many of her biggest fans don\u2019t seem to care about the \"bad judgment\" that resulted in MSNBC showing her the door. Olbermann blasted his former network, saying MSNBC\u2019s \"most outspoken and most probably its bravest host\" was fired on the eve of \"an election crucial to the safeguarding of democracy in this nation\" but none of her most-high profile colleagues seem to care. Former \"The Cross Connection\" host Tiffany Cross is believed to have irked MSNBC executives with divisive rhetoric.

Where is the anger from Chris Hayes? Where is the condemnation of a women\u2019s voice silenced from Alex Wagner? Where is the threat to walk out, to boycott, to quit, to stand on principal from Rachel Maddow? Whatever happens in the voting tomorrow, remember at all times that you and I do not have a true friend or an ally at MSNBC, at CNN, at CBS, at ABC. We have television performers who will make sure they are seen in the easy fights,\" Olbermann said. \"But when it is bad, who will draw a line and fight and protect one thing and one thing alone \u2013 they\u2019re paychecks.\" Olbermann continued to trash \"caged, declawed, gutless\" MSNBC personalities who haven\u2019t defended Cross and network executives who decided she was too much trouble. \"In throwing out Tiffany Cross, they\u2019re not only silencing a valuable voice who might have become an essentially one, but they\u2019re warning everybody else on the air at MSNBC\u2026 We fired her and we leaked it to the Washington Post that she was fired by another African-American woman, in large part because she was controversial.' And NBC Universal cannot have controversial right now because, you know, fascists also buy Comcast cable packages,\u2019\" Olbermann said, referring to MSNBC president Rashida Jones.

Olbermann then read a list of some of Cross\u2019 most polarizing comments, such as saying Florida should be \"castrated\" from the rest of the country and referring to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as \"Justice Pubic Hair on My Coke Can,\" and declared he would have been proud to come up with any of her zingers. \"They are not just incisive and wounding and well crafted, and directed at the scum of the earth\u2026 but they have the added benefit of having been true,\" Olbermann said. Olbermann said he wasn\u2019t surprised O\u2019Donnell kept his mouth shut because he is a \"snake,\" but said he was \"mystified\" Hayes and Maddow have been silent because they have gone to bat for colleagues in the past. Olbermann notably didn\u2019t mention MSNBC host Joy Reid, who declared her support for Cross. Reid, who has a long history of rhetoric similar to what landed Cross in hot water, closed her show on Friday by addressing her friend\u2019s ousting. Video \"Before I go, I really do just want to say one quick thing about my friend, colleague and sister Tiffany Cross,\" an emotional Reid began. \"She's not just my friend, she's my sister. I love her, I support her, I was boosting for her to get the show that she created, \u2018The Cross Connection,\u2019 which she put her heart and soul into every day.\" Olbermann noted Reid addressed the situation. \"I wish it had been more, but compared to what the other hosts did not say, she is on the Mount Rushmore of putting yourself at just a little risk to defend what is right,\" Olbermann said.

Far-left, former ESPN host Jemele Hill tweeted that she was \"outraged\" at the decision. \"To make this move a few days before the critical mid-terms is just unacceptable. There is a larger issue of strong Black pundits, especially women, lacking the internal support to thrive,\" Hll wrote. \"Supporting strong Black voices is not for the weak. Too often that support goes missing as soon as it becomes too threatening to the entrenched hierarchy. Tiffany is excellent at her job. I know she\u2019ll shine brighter. But what MSNBC has done is absolutely cowardly and shameful.\" When the former \"Cross Connection\" namesake tweeted a statement that she was \"disheartened\" by her firing\" many responded with uplifting messages. \"Your voice will always be relevant.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Here's some advice for anyone following Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections: Be ready for a long night and maybe days of waiting before it's clear whether Republicans or President Joe Biden's Democrats will control Congress. All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for grabs, as are 35 U.S. Senate seats and 36 governorships. Republicans would need to pick up five seats to take a majority in the House and just one to control the Senate. Nonpartisan election forecasters and polls suggest Republicans have a very strong chance of winning a House majority, with control of the Senate likely to be closer fought.

Because Democrats vote by mail more often than Republicans, states that let officials get an early jump on counting mail ballots could report big Democratic leads early on that evaporate as vote counters work through piles of Republican-leaning ballots that were cast on election day. In these \"blue mirage\" states - which include Florida and North Carolina - election officials are allowed to remove mail ballots from their envelopes before Election Day and load them in vote counting machines, allowing for speedy counting. States including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin don't allow officials to open the envelopes until Election Day, leading to a possible \"red mirage\" in which Republican-leaning Election Day ballots are reported earlier, with many Democratic-leaning mail ballots counted later. Experts like Joe Lenski, co-founder of Edison Research, which will be tracking hundreds of races on Tuesday and supplying Reuters and other media organizations with results, will keep an eye on the mix of different types of ballots each state is counting throughout the night. \"Blue mirage, red mirage, whatever. You just have to look at what types of votes are getting reported to know where you are in that state,\" said Lenski. PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICANS VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT MIDTERM BALLOT COUNTING IN LETTER TO SECRETARY OF STATE So When Do We Know Which Party Won? The first wave of vote tallies are expected on the East Coast between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET. An early indication of Republican success could come if the races expected to be close - like Virginia's 7th congressional district or a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina - turn out to be Democratic routs. By around 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. ET, when polls in the Midwest will be closed for an hour or more, it's possible Republicans will have enough momentum for experts at U.S. media organizations to project control of the House, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. If the fight for the House still looks close as vote tallies start coming in from the West Coast - where there could be more than a dozen tight House races - it could be days before control of the chamber is known, experts said.

Nevada and Washington state also allow late ballots if postmarked by Nov. 8, slowing down the march to final results. \"If the House is really on the edge, that would matter,\" said Kondik. It may take longer, perhaps weeks longer, to know which party will control the Senate, with close contests in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia likely to determine final control.

Control of the U.S. House of Representatives is at stake in Tuesday's midterms , with Republicans favored by nonpartisan forecasters to win control, which would allow them to block President Joe Biden's agenda and investigate his administration. Here are twelve races that could determine which party wins control of the chamber: Alaska's at-large District Democrat Mary Peltola won a surprise victory in an August special election, beating two Republicans: former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and businessman Nick Begich. Republicans objected to Alaska's new system of \"ranked choice\" voting, in which voters list candidates in order of preference, although Peltola would have won even under the old system as she got the most votes. The three will face off again in November. PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICANS VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT MIDTERM BALLOT COUNTING IN LETTER TO SECRETARY OF STATE Arizona's 2nd District Democratic Representative Tom O'Halleran faces a difficult race after his district covering much of the eastern half of the state was redrawn to include more Republican voters . His Republican opponent, Eli Crane, is a former Navy SEAL who in September 2021 called on Arizona's legislature to decertify Biden's win in 2020. California's 22nd District Republican Representative David Valadao was one of only 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in his second trial.

(REUTERS/Emily Elconin) Florida's 13th District This suburban Tampa district is one of several Democratic-held seats in Florida that Republicans are likely to pick up thanks to a new district map backed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis. Republican Anna Paulina Luna, a U.S. Air Force veteran, is favored over Democrat Eric Lynn, a former Obama administration official. Iowa's 3rd District Democrat Cindy Axne rode the Democrats' 2018 midterms \"blue wave\" to victory, but redistricting has made her district slightly more Republican this year. Zach Nunn, a state senator and former Air Force pilot, is hoping to capitalize on that. The issues of abortion and inflation are expected to dominate the race. Kansas's 3rd District Democrat Sharice Davids faces a difficult race after Republicans redrew her suburban Kansas City district to take in more rural, Republican-leaning areas. However, the national debate over abortion could work in her favor: voters in this conservative state in August rejected a constitutional amendment that would have banned the procedure. She will face Amanda Adkins, a former chair of the state Republican Party. Maine's 2nd District Democratic Representative Jared Golden narrowly won this mostly rural district in 2018. Now, he will face Republican Bruce Poliquin, who formerly held the seat. Golden is a moderate Democrat who often distances himself from party leadership, while Poliquin is emphasizing hot-button issues like immigration and gun rights, rather than the fiscal topics he ran on before. Two independent candidates have not drawn significant support but could be a factor because Maine, like Alaska, uses ranked choice voting .

Maloney is the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's U.S. House campaign arm, and ousting him would be a major win for Republicans. Ohio's 9th District Democrat Marcy Kaptur faces perhaps her most difficult re-election since 1983 after Republicans redrew her Toledo-area district. An Associated Press report that Republican nominee J.R. Majestic misrepresented his military career may have helped her chances.

Rhode Island's 2nd District Democrats were expected to easily hold their seat in this Northeast district, which has voted Democratic since 1991. But Republicans this year nominated Allan Fung, a local mayor, who has run as a moderate against Democratic state treasurer Seth Magaziner. Fung has heavily focused his campaign on inflation, while Magaziner argues that Fung would enable the far right House Republicans' agenda.

The FBI specifically pointed to one incident this year, when a 16-year-old Texas boy who requested an Uber ride found himself abducted. The teenager had ordered an Uber for a roughly 20-mile trip in April and was allegedly offered something to drink during the ride.

One of the top concerns, was that the minors would be sexually assaulted by a driver, according to the 2019 Ipsos Public Affairs study. Nearly 80% of parents of daughters were worried their child would face assault, while 55% of parents worried the same could happen to their sons. \u201cSafety is paramount to the Uber experience and the report outlined by the FBI is extremely concerning,\u201d an Uber spokesperson told Fox News Digital when approached for comment on the FBI\u2019s PSA. \u201cWe are always working to build features and policies designed with safety in mind, which is why we\u2019ve introduced many safety features into the app, like the Emergency Button; Live Help from a Safety Agent; Text-to-911 capability (where available); and GPS tracking on every trip. We also aim to do our part to raise awareness of these societal issues through education to help drivers spot the signs of human trafficking and report it.\u201d The spokesperson also noted that all drivers undergo \u201cbackground checks on the federal, state and local level,\u201d and that riders \u201cmust provide valid phone numbers, email addresses, and payment methods in order to use the platform \u2013 which is more than many other forms of transportation require.\u201d \u201cWe know our work on safety is never done, and we\u2019re committed to always working to raise the bar.\u201d Experts have also warned that teenagers are often more timid about speaking up if something feels off during their ride . \u201cTeens may feel awkward or inhibited to speak up if they notice a driver is not driving safely or if something does \u2018not feel right\u2019 about the car or the driver ,\u201d pediatrician and co-director of the 2019 poll Gary Freed told the Detroit Free Press. \u201cParents should empower their teens to feel comfortable to speak out or refuse a ride.

As complaints about elections, many of them unfounded, pile up around the country, investigators tasked with dealing with them find themselves on the front line of defending the integrity of America\u2019s system for choosing local, state and national leaders. In blue states like Oregon and red states like Idaho, elections officials say investigating the complaints is critical for maintaining voter confidence. Many are dealing with a sharp increase of complaints in the runup to the 2022 midterm election after unfounded claims of rampant voter fraud in 2020. In Oregon, the front line crosses the desk of Alma Whalen, fa 28-year-old who oversees election law investigations, campaign finance disclosures and compliance for the state's elections division. FLORIDA OFFICIALS CHARGE WOMAN WITH FELONY FRAUD FOR VOTING IN TWO STATES DURING MULTIPLE ELECTIONS At least 204 accusations have been filed this year, according to a complaints log obtained through a public records request. The complaints include accusations of campaign finance violations, public employees campaigning while on the job, and someone yelling about signs on lawns. Almost 20% of the accusations are about purported crimes. Details on those are exempt from disclosure under Oregon law and weren\u2019t included in the document. Helping Whalen sort through hundreds of complaints are Russ Buttram, who spent 20 years in the Marines and the next five as executive director of operations for a school district, and campaign finance expert Amanda Kessel. Their cubicles are next to Whalen's in the elections division office in Salem, Oregon's capital city. Alma Whalen, who oversees election law investigations, campaign finance disclosures and compliance for Oregon, holds a state voters' pamphlet during an interview on Oct. 17, 2022, in Salem, Oregon. (AP Photo/Andrew Selsky) Buttram started the job this year because \"this seemed like a place where I could make a difference, where the work was important.\" Written on a whiteboard in Whalen's cubicle, next to her to-do lists, is the phone number of an FBI agent to call in case of trouble. \"Not only are we seeing more requests for investigation and more cases that we\u2019re having to work on, we\u2019re facing a lot of pressure from people to come up with a certain decision that favors them,\" Whalen said, adding that some people try to barge into the office to make demands. On her bookshelf is an inspirational slogan that once adorned an Oregon newspaper: \"No favor sways us, no fear shall awe.\" Investigators like Whalen are becoming more in demand, and more important, as elections and political campaigns become more contentious and divisive. For the first time in Oregon, Whalen's position received full funding from the Legislature in 2021. In the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers will be asked to provide funding for two more positions, said Ben Morris, spokesman for Secretary of State Shemia Fagan. \"Having dedicated staff for investigations is critical,\" Morris said. A SIMPLE GUIDE TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS, HOW THEY AFFECT THE PRESIDENCY, AND MORE Trust in America\u2019s elections was shaken by former President Donald Trump and his allies claiming widespread fraud in 2020, but there is no evidence to back up those allegations. Numerous judicial rulings have rejected Trump\u2019s unfounded claims. In Idaho, a Republican stronghold, Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane is in charge of elections in the state's most populous county. Neither he, nor the Idaho secretary of state\u2019s office, has an employee dedicated exclusively to investigating election complaints, McGrane said. But the secretary of state works with the attorney general's office on them, said McGrane. McGrane is likely Idaho's next secretary of state, having won the Republican nomination. McGrane said he believes that the 2020 election was conducted properly and that Joe Biden won the presidency. In Ada County, which encompasses the state's largest city of Boise, McGrane's elections staff investigates complaints, which are often about campaign finance.

It\u2019s really important, as election officials, for us to pursue those cases so we can show that we're following through.\" Another fairly common complaint in Idaho is felons voting before completing their sentence, McGrane said. He added, though, that voter fraud is rare. \"I\u2019ve seen two competing narratives as I campaigned over this last year: there\u2019s rampant fraud and rampant cheating or the alternative, that there\u2019s no fraud and no cheating,\" he said. \"And the problem is, neither of those is true.\" \"Cases do exist, but they\u2019re not huge in volume,\" he said. \"Our elections are working properly. The system is working. And part of that is having people investigate these situations and hold people accountable when the law has been broken.\" Back in Salem, Whalen said election law investigations are critically important. \"The public cares about it. It impacts every person who is interested in voting or wants to vote,\" she said. As for attempts at intimidation, she said: \"Ultimately we hold the line.

Her order came after the Nevada Supreme Court issued an opinion siding with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s objections to the reading of individual votes out loud.

Rand Paul reaffirmed his faith in a \"hands off\" federal government in a final burst of campaigning across Kentucky on Monday, as he approached the finish line of his reelection bid against Democratic challenger Charles Booker. Paul headlined get-out-the vote rallies statewide ahead of the election ending Tuesday, while Booker concentrated on his hometown of Louisville, the state's largest city, after an extended statewide bus tour. Many Kentuckians cast ballots during early voting last week. The U.S. Senate race tops a long midterm ballot as Kentuckians prepared to elect representatives to Congress, the state legislature and local offices. MCGARVEY, RAY FACE OFF IN THE ONLY COMPETITIVE CONGRESSIONAL RACE IN KY Those contests were largely overshadowed by a proposed constitutional amendment dealing with abortion. The measure asked Kentuckians to decide whether the state's constitution should declare that it doesn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion. Defeat of the amendment would be a setback for legislative Republicans who put it on the ballot hoping to squelch challenges to anti-abortion laws. On another ballot measure, voters will decide whether the GOP-dominated legislature should have the power to call itself into special sessions. U.S. Sen.

Easley, File) Campaigning Monday, Paul said that Republicans had the momentum in Kentucky and nationally as the GOP looks to take control of Congress and solidify its dominance in the Bluegrass State. Stressing his libertarian beliefs, Paul described the GOP's approach as \"hands off,\" declaring: \"We\u2019re the party of leave me alone.\" With his staunchly anti-abortion stand, he did not include decisions about abortion in his litany of issues the government should stay out of. WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE KENTUCKY ELECTIONS, A STATE THAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY REPUBLICAN SINCE 2016 Paul, who is seeking a third term, has railed against what he sees as excessive federal spending \u2014 a theme he continued during the last day of campaigning. \"We are the party that believes that our rights come from our creator,\" the senator said. \"That our job as elected officials is not to get you a cell phone or free college or free food or free housing.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Both major parties say the Kansas governor's race is a toss-up in its last days as abortion politics, lingering ill will toward former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and an independent conservative candidate make for a tighter-than-expected contest in the Republican-leaning state. Democratic incumbent Gov. Laura Kelly should be on the defensive as the only Democratic governor in the U.S. running for reelection in a state carried by former President Donald Trump in 2020. But a decisive statewide vote in August affirming abortion rights energized Democrats and moderates and boosted Kelly's chance of holding the votes crucial to her victory four years ago. GOP challenger Derek Schmidt hopes to tap voter frustration with inflation and crime. Kelly has largely stayed on a message that Kansas is financially healthy again after past budget woes tied to Brownback, with Schmidt a key political ally. \"I am more confident than I have been,\" said Joan Wagnon, a former Kansas Democratic Party chair and ex-Topeka mayor. THE END OF ROE HAS PREVENTED AT LEAST 10,000 LEGAL ABORTIONS: REPORT Schmidt, the state\u2019s three-term attorney general, is ending his campaign on the attack with \"Kansas Can Do Better\" rallies around the state. Kelly and other Democrats did \"Meet Me in the Middle\" events set for the final weekend and Monday after her allies had a \"Back on Track, Can't Go Back\" tour. \"It\u2019s not that I ignore national issues. You know, I understand that inflation is an issue,\" Kelly told reporters after a recent event in Topeka. \"But I think people in the state of Kansas want me to focus on the things that I actually have some control over.\" Many Republicans' early expectations of a comfortable victory for Schmidt faded months ago. Yet for all the unexpected sweating, Republicans still think Schmidt can bank on national GOP midterm momentum. \"Folks are working hard, making things happen in their community, and frustrated with the Biden-Kelly Democrat philosophy that values big government over freedom,\" Schmidt posted on Facebook after one small-town event this week. Kelly has spent more than $7 million on her reelection, roughly twice as much as Schmidt through late October. Outside groups have boosted the spending on television ads past $40 million. Schmidt's hopes rest in part on energy from the August abortion vote fading , something some abortion rights advocates said they've felt. Schmidt supported the measure on the ballot, a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow the GOP-controlled Legislature to greatly restrict or ban abortion. Kelly opposed it, but she hasn't focused on abortion access as an issue. Turnout so far among people voting in advance is higher than for the August election, which set a record for a Kansas primary. Yet it's also lower than in November 2018, when Democrats tapped suburban discontent with Trump and the Republican nominee for governor was Kris Kobach, known nationally as an immigration and election fraud provocateur. Schmidt joined Republicans nationwide in pivoting to crime last month, though the state recently reported a small decrease in violent crime in 2021 compared with 2020. He pointed to Kelly's appointment of a racial justice commission and her comments that systemic racism is a problem in law enforcement to suggest that she's anti-police. Kansas Democratic Gov.

Thomas/Getty Images) Republicans pounded Kelly with ads over her two vetoes of two proposals to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s school, club and college sports. Schmidt also attacked Kelly over state-administered grants to arts venues that later hosted drag shows, which have been a bugaboo for the right across the U.S. for months. Kansas registration benefits Republicans, who represent 44.7% of those registered statewide. Unaffiliated voters, at 27.8%, beat out Democrats at 26.5%. \"A lot people are just pretty fed up with government in general, especially the Trump folks,\" said Tim Shallenburger, a former state treasurer and Kansas Republican Party chair. \"Biden has got them motivated, not Laura Kelly, or not Derek Schmidt.\" Yet for all of the playing to issues that rile Republicans, Shallenburger said, \"I don't see a landslide brewing.\" Independent state Sen. Dennis Pyle is one reason. He is a former Republican and one of the state's most conservative legislators and is attacking Schmidt from the right. Pyle raised only $90,000 in cash as of late October, but an outside Democratic group aired radio ads, sent mailers and texted messages in the campaign's final weeks portraying Pyle as the true conservative and Schmidt as a poser. Republicans were outraged . The Democratic group jumped in to help Pyle after Kelly built much of her message on an argument that Schmidt represented a return to a recent conservative past. Kelly and her allies attacked Schmidt for standing politically with Brownback and not protesting a failed 2012-13 experiment in cutting taxes under Brownback that was followed by persistent budget shortfalls. Legislators repealed most of the tax-cutting experiment in 2017, and Kelly is making much of the state's improved finances on her watch. The state treasury is flush, with tax collections exceeding expectations every month for more than two years. Kelly's office also publicizes projects like plans for a new biotechnology lab in the Kansas City area and the planned expansion of a pizza manufacturing plant in Salina, some 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Topeka. Kelly joined other dignitaries this week in donning hard hats and digging up the first few shovelfuls of earth for a multibillion-dollar Panasonic Corp. plant in the Kansas City area for making batteries for electric vehicles.

On Tuesday, two Oregon counties, Morrow and Wheeler, are set to vote on a ballot measure about whether to explore leaving the state. Since 2020, nine counties in Eastern Oregon have already voted to join the Greater Idaho movement . \u201cPeople in Eastern Oregon are just different and have different views on crime, the Second Amendment, abortion, taxes and minimum wage [from the western portion of the state],\u201d Matt McCaw, spokesman for Greater Idaho, told The Post. \u201cThe polarization with the western part of the state is real. When I meet with people and host meetings, there are a lot of complaints about the lack of representation. Eastern Oregon is just very conservative and has its own culture.\u201d So he and a group of fellow disgruntled Oregonians in the small city of La Pine began to hash out a plan to secede because they no longer felt represented by the liberal lawmakers in the state capital, Salem. The solution: Join Idaho, where the Republican Party is firmly in control. \u201cEastern Oregon, where we all live, could get state-level government from Idaho that matches their values,\u201d McCaw said. It\u2019s a radical proposition that would see nearly two-thirds of Oregon\u2019s 63 million acres (98,000 square miles), but less than 10% of its population, blend into neighboring Idaho. McCaw, 46, said the movement\u2019s leaders are hoping to attract 15 of the state\u2019s 36 counties and two partial ones to join Idaho. \u201cWe asked the simple question, \u2018Would you like your elected leaders to change the border?\u2019 and we\u2019ve won our last six elections with more than 60% of the vote,\u201d McCaw told The Post. For McCaw, who owns a small math-curriculum company with his wife, and his supporters, the largely rural and conservative residents of Eastern Oregon have very little in common with their progressive urban neighbors in western cities like Portland, Eugene and Bend. In the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump dominated Eastern Oregon, receiving nearly 80% of the vote in some counties, but President Biden ultimately won 56.5% of votes thanks to liberal cities. Nearly 64 percent of Idaho residents voted for Trump, with 33 percent voting for Biden. Oregon\u2019s current governor, Democrat Kate Brown, has a 56% disapproval rating, the worst in the US. Brown, whose term expires next year, has been criticized for doing little to stem rising crime and homelessness in the state\u2019s urban centers since she became governor in 2015. Some Oregonians are so fed up with spiraling crime, easy access to drugs and homelessness that \u2014 for the first time in 40 years \u2014 Oregon may see a Republican become governor . Christine Drazan, 50, a former Oregon House minority leader, has a slight lead over her closest opponent, former Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Democrat. Independent Betsy Johnson is also in the race, and some predict she might split the blue vote. But even the prospect of a Republican governor would not help the situation for those in the eastern part of the state, said Sandie Gilson, who lives in Grant County, one of the first Oregon counties to vote in 2020 to explore joining Idaho. \u201cEven if we have a Republican governor, the Democrats still have a supermajority in the legislature,\u201d said Gilson, 56, a fifth-generation Oregonian whose gold-miner great-great-grandfather arrived in the state in the 1800s. \u201cIt will change nothing.\u201d Gilson and her husband are small-business owners who say they want to be self-sufficient in a rural region where making an emergency call to police could result in a two-hour wait for help. The couple, who own firearms, say they are not able to defend themselves if faced with an emergency, because of government mandates. Last year, the state enacted a safe storage law that requires the owners of firearms to keep them locked up. \u201cIt would take us more than five minutes to unlock our guns, and in that time a lot could happen,\u201d Gilson told The Post. \u201cThe legislature does things that just don\u2019t make sense for us.\u201d Gilson also said she doesn\u2019t feel safe after Oregon decriminalized personal portions of all drugs in 2020 and, earlier this year, instituted bail reform laws that allows defendants charged with misdemeanors and some felonies to be released without posting bail. \u201cHow does that make me safe in my home?\u201d Gilson said, adding that residents in Eastern Oregon, which has a fraction of the population of the western part of the state, generally get outvoted. Like Gilson, Mike McCarter, 75, said residents in Eastern Oregon are almost always getting outvoted by the much more populous western region. McCarter, who lives in La Pine and is one of the founders of Greater Idaho, told The Post that eastern residents voted two to one against recreational drug use, but \u201cWestern Oregon wanted it, and they carried the vote.\u201d Still, McCarter insists that the movement for a Greater Idaho is not a political one. \u201cWe try to keep the movement away from politics,\u201d he said. \u201cOur movement is a traditional-values type movement of faith \u2014 of people who value freedom, independence and self-sufficiency.\u201d In 2020, Gov. Brad Little of Idaho said he welcomed the move , adding, \u201cThey\u2019re looking at Idaho fondly because of our regulatory atmosphere, our values. What they\u2019re interested [in] is they would like to have a little more autonomy, a little more control, a little more freedom and I can understand that.\u201d Although states have had their borders reconfigured in the past \u2014 Maine seceded from Massachusetts in 1820 \u2014 there is no historical precedent for large land masses to leave one state and join another. Ryan Griffiths, a political science professor at Syracuse University who studies the secession of sovereign states, told The Post that \u201cthe bar is pretty high\u201d for state secession in the US. \u201cThis is not the kind of thing that is done unilaterally by people in counties,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cThey have to get the state of Oregon on board and the state of Idaho, and that\u2019s a very high bar.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [23.0411434173584, 9.016814231872559]}, {"title": "Prince Andrew wept when King Charles told him he\u2019d never return to royal life: report", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/prince-andrew-wept-when-king-charles-told-him-hed-never-return-to-royal-life-report/", "description": "Andrew was \"blindsided\" and reduced to tears by his brother's words during a morning meeting shortly before the death of their mother, Queen Elizabeth II.", "content": "King Charles III firmly told Prince Andrew that he will never return to royal duties \u2014 leaving his disgraced younger brother \u201cutterly bereft\u201d and in tears, according to a report.

The 2022-23 season opens Monday, but the first week of November was once known for coaches universally lamenting, \"We've just got to get a lot better,\" as they prepped for exhibitions. Consider 1986-87, when Tennessee won the first of its eight NCAA titles: The Lady Vols started that season Nov. 29. Their perfect season, 1997-98, started Nov. 18. By the time they made their last trip to the women's Final Four, 2007-08, it was Nov. 11. This year, Tennessee fans were raring to go in August. The No. 5 Lady Vols start the season Tuesday with an immediate test: at No. 14 Ohio State. Monday's schedule includes 16 games that involve top 25 teams, including No. 1 South Carolina, the defending national champion, which faces East Tennessee State (8:30 p.m. ET, SEC Network). The Gamecocks are favorites to repeat their title, and South Carolina star Aliyah Boston is expected to sweep the major national awards, as she did last year. As always, there are several questions heading into the season, which will conclude at the women's Final Four in Dallas from March 31 to April 2. One question is just how big a year it might be for the Gamecocks' SEC rival Tennessee. We look at that and the other things we're watching as women's hoops tips off, and are joined by ESPN's Charlie Creme and Alexa Philippou for preseason predictions. Jump to Final Four and player of the year predictions Will Tennessee return to the Final Four in 2023? It's poignant to think that after superstar Candace Parker led the Lady Vols to back-to-back NCAA titles in 2007 and 2008, coach Pat Summitt had just four seasons remaining on the sidelines. Tennessee has been through a lot in the last 14 years, during which Summitt died in 2016 after a battle with early-onset dementia, Alzheimer's type. In that time, the Lady Vols had five Elite Eight losses, five early-round exits and two coaching changes. They watched UConn win six NCAA titles in that stretch, while Baylor and South Carolina each won two national championships and the Gamecocks moved to the top of the SEC. Tennessee returned to the Sweet 16 last year for the first time since 2016, when they made the Elite Eight. Senior guard Jordan Horston returns after missing the postseason with an elbow injury, along with other impact players such as center Tamari Key. Forward Rickea Jackson is one of the nation's top transfers. The excitement around Tennessee feels like the old days. Tennessee will always celebrate its past, but the program and these players deserve to be looked at in context of the current competitive women's hoops world. At one time, the Lady Vols' success was determined by whether they made the Final Four. Now, being in the running for that is a more realistic measure. There's good reason to think they will be in 2023. Will UConn's Final Four streak end? It took an epic 91-87 double-overtime victory against NC State in the Bridgeport Regional final last season for UConn to extend its astonishing Final Four streak to 14 in a row. Once this streak is over, it's unlikely we will see anything like it again. Some thought it might end in 2012, the season after Maya Moore graduated. Then maybe in 2017, after the Huskies lost Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck, who won four consecutive NCAA titles. After Napheesa Collier and Katie Lou Samuelson departed in 2019, we can only speculate what might have happened in the 2020 tournament canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Huskies were 29-3 that season. In 2021, led by freshman Paige Bueckers, UConn reached the Final Four in the NCAA tournament bubble in San Antonio. Bueckers had 27 points in last season's Elite Eight victory, and then UConn beat defending champ Stanford in the national semifinals. The loss to South Carolina in the final was the first time UConn had been defeated in a NCAA championship game. Bueckers and freshman Ice Brady are both out this season with knee injuries. Christyn Williams, Olivia Nelson-Ododa and Evina Westbrook have graduated and moved on to the pro game. Coach Geno Auriemma is concerned about depth. But sophomore Azzi Fudd could have a huge season, and other players such as juniors Nika M\u00fchl and Aaliyah Edwards might make big jumps. It might be more of a challenge for the No. 6 Huskies to finish in Dallas this year, but nobody is counting them out. Can a mid-major team advance to the Final Four? The evidence of the past 20 years points to no; the last so-called mid-major to make it that far was Missouri State in 2001. Huge concentrations of talent are still in the Power 5 and at UConn, a powerhouse that sits separate of the \"mid-major\" label despite, since 2013-14, being in the American Athletic Conference and then the remade Big East. There are some outstanding mid-major players. It's just difficult to have enough of them to overcome what are typically low NCAA tournament seeds and especially difficult paths to the Final Four. With home sites for the top 16 seeds in the women's game, just getting to the Sweet 16 is a big accomplishment for double-digit seeds. Two of them did it in March, as two No. 10 seeds, Creighton and South Dakota, knocked off Iowa and Baylor, respectively, who were No. 2 seeds and hosts. The Bluejays went all the way to the regional final, where they fell to South Carolina. No. 11 seed Princeton came close to the Sweet 16, too, upsetting No. 6 seed Kentucky in the first round before falling to No. 3 seed Indiana 56-55 in the second round. In this year's preseason poll, three mid-majors are ranked: No. 21 Creighton (Big East), the No. 23 South Dakota State (Summit League), and No. 24 Princeton (Ivy League). Two of them start the season against each other Monday, as Creighton travels to South Dakota State (8 p.m. ET, ESPN3) in a game that could have implications for March. Princeton opens Monday vs. the Temple (5 p.m. ET, ESPN+). How will these coaches adjust to replacing program stalwarts? This season, three coaches are replacing longtime Power 5 fixtures who have retired. Coquese Washington is now guiding Rutgers, taking over for C. Vivian Stringer. Joni Taylor will replace Gary Blair with Texas A&M. And Natasha Adair is in charge of Arizona State, replacing Charli Turner Thorne. Last season, Nicki Collen had one of the more difficult takeovers ever, as she followed Kim Mulkey at Baylor. Mulkey won three NCAA titles and dominated the Big 12 for the last decade of her time at Baylor. Plus, she didn't retire, she left to coach the LSU Tigers. Collen has been frank in acknowledging it has taken time to get past Mulkey's shadow in Waco, Texas. For Washington, Taylor and Adair, things are a little different. Rutgers (11-20), Texas A&M (14-15) and Arizona State (12-14) all had losing records last season. Stringer, Blair and Turner Thorne were an extremely successful coaching trio, but also seemed ready to move on in their lives. It means new eras at their respective programs, and the coaches who follow them can feel like the fresh start is going to be embraced by players and fans. Taylor was SEC coach of the year in 2021 with Georgia, so she already knows the league as well as anybody. Washington was Penn State coach for 12 seasons, from 2007 to 2019, and she is well-versed in the Big Ten. Things are a little different for Adair, whose life and career have been on the East Coast before this move. She comes to Tempe after five years with Delaware, who made the NCAA tournament last season. Other coaches in new spots to watch this season include Dawn Plitzuweit, who takes over for retired Mike Carey with West Virginia, and Amaka Agugua-Hamilton, who replaces Tina Thompson at Virginia. What will players, coaches and fans think of the new two-regional system? Maximizing attendance at the NCAA tournament has long been a concern in women's basketball, which is the major reason for having early-round games at home sites of the top 16 seeds. The NCAA has experimented with other early-round formats, including having 16 pre-determined sites and eight pre-determined sites. Starting this season, the NCAA will do something completely different with the regionals: there will be two instead of four. When the NCAA first announced this in 2019, it said the reason was to try to maximize attendance and commit to a better overall experience for student-athletes. It's notable, though, that this decision was made two years before the NCAA was exposed in 2021 with the obvious inequities between the men's and women's tournaments in COVID-19 bubbles in Indianapolis and San Antonio. Would the NCAA have made the same decision to go to two regionals after essentially being shamed for shortchanging the women's tournament in 2021? We can only speculate. But this is the format for now, with two regionals assigned out through 2026. This year, they are in Greenville, South Carolina and Seattle. Obviously, the point of the traditional four regionals is to make them, quite literally, \"regional\" and spread across the country for attendance and television window purposes. Two regionals on opposite coasts means the Central and Mountain time zones are left out entirely. In fact, there are only two regionals in either of those time zones over the next four years: in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2025 and Fort Worth, Texas, in 2026, both Central time zone cities. The NCAA will be under some pressure to prove that this format change really is for the best for the sport, the teams and the fans. We will see how it plays out. 2022-23 Season predictions Make one bold prediction for 2022-23 Charlie Creme: Caitlin Clark will be the national player of the year. Dethroning a reigning player of the year is rare, and Aliyah Boston remains the better player. However, Clark is more flashy and her numbers are staggering. If she and Iowa get off to a quick start, the mainstream media attention that Clark began to receive last season will build even earlier. An avalanche of momentum behind her candidacy will be hard to overcome if Clark has a season similar or slightly better than last year. So this is really more of a prediction of how others will vote, rather than how I might. Alexa Philippou: After going wire-to-wire as the top team in the country last season, South Carolina will fall out of the No. 1 position at some point in 2022-23 -- and maybe even double their total loss count from 2021-22 (two). Destanni Henderson's steadiness at the point will be missed early on, particularly as the Gamecocks face Maryland and Stanford in November before delving into SEC play. Zia Cooke will emerge as a more consistent threat to help out Boston, while Kierra Fletcher and/or Raven Johnson will settle into the point guard roles. Even if the Gamecocks look vulnerable during the regular season, behind their experience and Dawn Staley's guidance they'll still put the pieces together in time to win the national title. M.A. Voepel: For the first time since 2008, UConn will fall short of the women's Final Four. The loss of four players (through graduation or injury) among the Huskies' top six scorers from last season will be something the team works to overcome. UConn will still be Big East champion, but will lose in the NCAA Elite Eight. Which teams reach the Final Four?

Reuters; Abigail Dollins/Statesman Journal/USA Today Network/Reuters hide caption Left : Mike Erickson, a Republican candidate from Oregon, running for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, appears in a photo provided Oct. 11, 2022. Right: Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Lake Oswego, speaks at a PCUN rally to kick off a campaign for farmworker overtime on Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021 at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem, Ore. On a recent rainy Saturday, about two dozen Democratic volunteers squeezed into a small office in a Portland, Oregon suburb. Democratic candidate Andrea Salinas addressed canvassers at her Tualatin, Oregon office in an increasingly tight race in the state's new 6th Congressional District. \"Thank you all so much. I consider this soggy sock season here in Oregon when we're all out there canvassing and making sure we're talking to voters,\" Salinas said. The state of Oregon has long been a safe blue haven for Democrats. But this year, Republicans are threatening upsets in races across the state. Recently, the Cook Political Report shifted Oregon's newest congressional district from lean Democratic to a toss-up as the GOP candidate there gains momentum. The district, which was the center of one of the most expensive races in the country earlier this year , runs southwest of Portland into vast wine country and past the state capital of Salem. The district's mix of urban and rural areas is making for tight political race this year, said Chris Stout, a politics professor at Oregon State University. \"In a year like 2022, where Republicans are having an advantage and people are concerned about crime... inflation, it makes it a much more competitive race,\" Stout said. Ultimately, the contest in this district could help tell a larger national story about how far the Republican Party's reach truly goes this election cycle. The new Oregon congressional district also boasts the state's largest concentration of Latino residents, with 21% identifying as Hispanic. Yolanda Welch, who came out to canvass for Salinas, said she relates to Salinas' Mexican roots. \"She grew up like me,\" Welch, who moved to Oregon region in 1974, said in her native Spanish. Welch said Salinas, a former longtime state lawmaker, can respond to rising inflation. Welch, a working caretaker, said she's turned off by the GOP. \"I'm not like Republicans. They have so much money. I don't,\" Welch said with a laugh. The district's GOP candidate, Mike Erickson, is a wealthy supply chain executive who has self funded much of his campaign. So far, both sides have raised more than $2 million dollars. Erickson has gained traction with rural voters while Salinas commands support in urban and suburban areas And recently, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee tied to House GOP leaders, dumped another $800,000 dollars in ads into the district. In an emailed statement to NPR, Erickson said Oregonians have tired of higher costs and a long-running homeless crisis that has not improved under Democrats' watch. \"Oregonians are struggling with out-of-control inflation and gas prices due to reckless Democrat spending. Oregonians are tired of watching our state falling behind in education, disrespecting and underfunding law enforcement, and allowing camping on public property,\" Erickson said. \"The Democrats have had decades to work on and solve the problem, and it just is getting worse.\" Erickson also said he believes he's well-positioned to represent the district's Latino population because of his business background and ability to address inflation. He's a perennial Republican candidate and lost several previous election runs. In past runs, Erickson was hurt after he was linked to an ex-girlfriend's abortion and recently said he wasn't aware the woman sought the service . He was also arrested in 2016 for driving under the influence. He's now suing Salinas over a related ad to the DUI arrest. Erickson declined to elaborate on the claims to NPR, but told the Oregonian the DUI arrest was one mistake against the law. \"I've never been perfect,\" he said. A costly election fight Erickson and his supporters say despite past setbacks, this year is his chance to get to the U.S. Capitol. At a coffee shop in the town of McMinnville, Republican Chris Chenoweth says despite those setbacks, timing is finally on Erickson's side \"I think Mike's going to win,\" Chenoweth said. Chenoweth, who sits on McMinnville's city council, which is located in a rural pocket of Oregon's 6th Congressional District, said national issues are energizing the district's Republicans. \"You start looking at your bread and butter kitchen table issues. It's headwinds against the Democrats for this election cycle,\" Chenoweth said. Salinas, who won a bitter Democratic primary this year , remains bullish as she talks more about the economy and other top worries. \"I don't have to be the... flag bearer for the Democratic Party,\" Salinas said. \"I want to be the flag bearer for the people of the 6th Congressional District. Right. And really addressing their needs, because I know that people are suffering right now. And that is what motivates me to do the work.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [22.774402618408203, 8.522454261779785]}, {"title": "Inside a Michigan clinic, patients talk about abortion \u2014 and a looming statewide vote", "link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/07/1131353552/michigan-abortion-legal-ballot-clinic", "description": "Michigan faces a key vote on abortion rights as patients travel there from other states.

The night before her abortion, Melissa had to travel to another state. She drove overnight from Ohio to Michigan, and didn't reach her hotel until 3 a.m. But just a few hours later, she had arrived on time for her 8 a.m. check-in at the front desk of Northland Family Planning in Sterling Heights, Mich. Melissa is part of a record surge of abortion patients pouring into Michigan since Roe v. Wade was overturned this summer. For nearly three months, Melissa says, she had been trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to find an abortion closer to home. By the time she arrived at Northland, she was 14 weeks pregnant. \"I was so relieved, after the struggle,\" Melissa says, \"Because I had to sit with [this pregnancy] for weeks.\" NPR agreed to not to use full names for all the patients interviewed in this story because of the intimate medical information discussed concerning a highly politicized and controversial issue. This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News . The Northland waiting room is built to feel welcoming, even pretty. Big windows look out on tall pines bending in the breeze. The TV is set to the cheerful chatter of women remodeling their modern farmhouses on HGTV. On the walls are inspirational quotes, including \"Good women get abortions.\" And \"Brave, beautiful women have been where you are right now.\" The patients here wait quietly, and alone \u2014 no spouses, no boyfriends, no family or friends. Melissa had swept her hair into a loose bun, and pulled her hands inside the sleeves of her sweatshirt. Finally she was here. She had made it. Northland was started in 1976 by Renee Chelian. She had undergone an illegal abortion at age 15, back in 1966, seven years before Roe v. Wade . \"'You can never tell anyone, because no man will ever marry you if he knows that this has happened,'\" Chelian recalled her father telling her afterward. 'You're going to be OK. We're going to take care of you. After this conversation, we'll never discuss it again.'\" Northland now has three locations in the greater Detroit region. Across Michigan, there are more than two dozen clinics that provide abortions. In recent months, patients have been traveling to Michigan for abortion care from Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, even as far as Florida and Texas. But abortion rights in Michigan are far from certain: court battles have been continuing for months over a 1931 state law that criminalized abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest. After Roe v. Wade established a federal right to abortion, that law lay dormant for decades, but was still on the books. Earlier this year, both Planned Parenthood and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer filed lawsuits to prevent the law from going back into effect. So far, courts have blocked enforcement of the 1931 law. But the appeals and judicial wrangling continue \u2014 and the uncertainty has been stressful and confusing for abortion providers in Michigan. On August 1 for example, rapid-fire court rulings meant that abortion in Michigan was legal at breakfast, illegal at lunchtime, but legal once again by dinner.

Ultimately, if abortion is going to stay legal in Michigan, it could come down to this election. On Tuesday, voters will decide whether to pass Proposal 3 , which would explicitly enshrine the right to abortion in the Michigan constitution, as well as other reproductive rights. Today, anyone visiting Northland Family Planning's website is greeted with a pop-up window urging them to vote 'Yes' on Prop 3 on Nov. 8. Northland's founder Chelian, now 71, is like a hummingbird: a petite powerhouse who never stops moving. She has spent most of her adult life pouring that energy into creating the clinics she wished had existed when she was 15: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, where soothing music plays in the procedure rooms. After their appointments, patients receive a brown paper bag with their prescriptions inside, and their names and a small heart drawn in pink marker on the front. Northland feels very different from the first place Melissa went to a few months ago, when she discovered she was pregnant. At first, she panicked. A mom of two, Melissa was going through a divorce, working full time, and getting her bachelor's degree. She called what she thought was a women's health clinic near her home in Ohio, and staff there promised her they could refer her for an abortion. When she arrived, a nurse gave her an ultrasound and told her she was a few weeks pregnant. But then the appointment took an unexpected turn. \"She wanted to pray for me,\" Melissa says. \"She gave me a Bible. It didn't even seem like it was religion until the very end ... They were posing to be so pro-choice, and they're not.\" Melissa had ended up at a crisis pregnancy center. Such centers are usually religious, and most aren't licensed medical clinics, though their advertising can be misleading. Their primary goal is to convince people not to get an abortion. At Northland, Melissa cried as she remembered the confrontational conversations she had with staff inside the crisis pregnancy center. \"I'm in this weird situation of, I'm going through a divorce, and I slept with somebody one time. And then I got pregnant. And they were like, 'Are you sure that you don't see a future with this guy? What if we brought him in here?' They were trying to talk me into having a baby that I couldn't have, and then they're trying to talk me into a relationship. It's crazy.\" Once Melissa understood the Ohio center wasn't going to help her, she tried to make her own appointment. At the time, abortions in Ohio were banned after six weeks. And every clinic near her home had long wait lists. By the time Melissa got this appointment in Michigan, she was 14 weeks pregnant. \"And I just feel so much better, because I have two kids, I have a ten-year-old and a two-year-old,\" she says, taking a deep breath. \"It shouldn't be this hard.\" Renee Chelian has spent most of her adult life pouring energy into creating the kind of clinics she wishes existed when she was 16: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, with sunny rooms full of soothing music. Paulette Parker/Michigan Radio hide caption Renee Chelian has spent most of her adult life pouring energy into creating the kind of clinics she wishes existed when she was 16: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, with sunny rooms full of soothing music. When Melissa's name is called, a staff member brings her from the waiting area into one of the procedure rooms, where she meets the doctor who'll perform her procedure: obstetrician-gynecologist Audrey Lance. \"Hi!\" Dr. Lance says warmly, entering the room. \"What questions do you have?\" Like many of the patients who come here, Lance has kids, and the shared experiences of parenthood \u2014 Halloween costumes, soccer games, the agony and ecstasies of living with a toddler \u2014 provide most of the small talk before the procedure begins, or the abortion pills are dispensed. An empty exam room at Northland Family Planning in Sterling Heights, Mich. Paulette Parker/Michigan Radio hide caption An empty exam room at Northland Family Planning in Sterling Heights, Mich. Earlier this year, Lance was dyeing the tips of her short brown hair purple \u2014 it helps nervous young patients relax when she walks in and they see their abortion doctor is actually a woman with cool purple hair. Every little moment of connection and ease is important, given how public, politicized and ugly the legal fights over abortion have become, Lance says. \"It has been a hard couple of months, ever since the Dobbs decision.\" In Michigan, the fighting in the courts about the state's 1931 abortion ban continued for months. Was it in effect or not? Could it be enforced? \"And it seems like every week, sometimes every day, there was a new thing happening that was affecting how we could work, or whether we could work and whether we could continue to provide care,\" Lance says. \"People care about this,\" Lance says. \"People are pissed. They are really, really pissed.\" Despite the turmoil of recent months, she's optimistic Prop. 3 will pass, and nullify forever any threat from that 1931 ban. \"I am hopeful. But...\" she sighs, then pauses. \"I think you just have to be. How could I come to work everyday if I wasn't?\" Northland's clinic in Sterling Heights sees about 22 to 24 patients a day. On the nine days a public radio reporter visited, about half of the patients agreed to an interview or allowed the reporter to accompany them during the office visit or surgical procedure. The patients wanted to explain what abortion access meant for their own lives - especially given the upcoming ballot referendum in Michigan: If people are going to be voting on this, I want them to know what this really looks like. Among them was a woman in her early 30s who wanted to be identified only by her first initial, A. A. is a slender, energetic mom with big, bright eyes. She's quick to cut through any tension with a joke. But she dissolves into tears when asked about why she came to Northland. \"I don't think I could survive if I knew that I had to have these babies with an abusive person,\" A. says. \"That's insanity to me. I feel like a prisoner.\" A. has two toddler girls, and says her former partner had been violent. She took the girls and left, and was trying to get a personal protection order when she found out she was pregnant with twins. She told her 3-year-old daughter that she wasn't going to keep this pregnancy. \"My daughter was so cute. She said, 'OK, well, maybe another time, maybe later.' I was like, 'Yes, maybe later.'\" Her face clouds over. \"Because she doesn't know that at the end of the day I can't physically, financially or mentally handle two more kids.\" She's tried in the past to get her tubes tied, she says. \"I've asked and begged to be, like, fixed or snipped or whatever it is that they have to do. They deny me,\" she says, sobbing. \"But then I end up on medication for birth control. It's insanity.\" \"And I'm so fertile that it's like, literally, I just, I have to stop having sex in order not to be pregnant. So, abortion, even though this is my first one, I'm happy that it's here because I don't know what I would do right now.\" After a moment, A. wipes the tears off her face. She manages a small smile. \"That's more sharing than I've done in like, ten years. I'm like the Grinch: my heart's getting bigger.\" A. is what you might imagine when you think about why someone would need an abortion: An abusive relationship. Money problems. Emotional distress. And you do see a lot of that at Northland. But you also see patients who are in great relationships, they're financially stable, and emotionally composed. Women like M. \u2014 who also asked to be identified only by her first initial. \"I want to go back to work and just kind of have something for myself other than just be a mother all day, every day,\" she says, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. M. is married and has three kids, the youngest of which is about to enter school. After ten years of staying at home with her children, M. felt like she was on the cusp of something new. \"And I wouldn't trade my kids for anything, I love them to death,\" M. says. \"But I just feel like that phase of my life is over. And it was an amazing phase. But I don't want to keep going back. I want to go forward.\" Dr. Audrey Lance prepares for a procedure. Paulette Parker/Michigan Radio hide caption Dr. Audrey Lance prepares for a procedure. At Northland, the pills for medication abortions are prescribed and dispensed in the morning, while the afternoon is dedicated to the surgical procedures. \"Okay, so I'm just going to get you set up on the table and we're going to do that sedation medicine,\" Lance tells one patient, who agreed that the reporter could observe and record her procedure, but asked that she not be identified. The woman, who is from Michigan and already has a toddler, was about 11 weeks pregnant. Nearly 90% of abortions performed in Michigan are done within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 and more than half are medication abortions. Once the procedure starts, the lights are dimmed and soothing music plays. The patient wears a medical gown, her bare legs in stirrups, and the staffer next to her, holds her hand and guides her through it. For several of the procedures that the reporter observed, Northland staff member Brandee was the person who comforted and coached the patients. \"Squeeze my hand, and just keep breathing,\" she says, leaning in close. It's typical for patients to be partially awake during first trimester abortions . Northland Family Planning gives every patient numbing medication applied to the cervix, and intravenous medications for pain and anxiety (fentanyl and midazolam). You may feel some strong cramping and intense pressure, Lance tells her patient, \"but I know you can do it.\" You're going to blow out your breath like you're blowing out a candle, Brandee instructs, firmly and clearly. The patient grips Brandee's hand tighter, her eyes squinting in discomfort. \"I can't,\" the patient gasps at one point, when the cramps became intense. \"You can do it,\" Brandee says. \"Keep breathing. You're almost done. Just keep breathing.\" And then, after just a couple minutes, it's over. \"You did it!\" Brandee says. The patient's relief is palpable. \"Thank you guys so much,\" she murmurs. At Northland, what you hear a lot from patients is: I'm doing this because I have this picture for my life, and the things I want. One woman, who asked that we not identify her, says she knows she wants to be a mom eventually. But first, she wants to finish school. Sitting in the waiting area, this patient talked about how hard the journey to Northland had been. How she hid it from her mom at first, until her aunties threatened to tell her mom if she didn't do it herself. How her mom was surprisingly supportive, getting up early with her that morning, and making sure she ate a good breakfast before her appointment. The patient shifted from side to side in her chair. She wore a spotless set of matching sweats, a low ponytail tucked beneath a crisp baseball hat. Sure, she says, she knows that a lot of women get abortions. But that doesn't make this feel any easier. \"We feel like we have to sneak in, do this,\" she says. \"Some of us put our lives at risk doing it.\" But she did not want to be trapped with the guy who got her pregnant, she says. She asked him if he could help her pay for this abortion. But the most he could do, he told her, was split it. \"The guys, they're never held responsible for things like this, ever,\" she says. \"It's always the woman. We always got to step up and take care of it. Whether we keep it or not, it's always put in our lap.\" Nearly every patient interviewed at Northland knew about Prop. 3, the constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in Michigan. Some of them were hopeful it would pass. Others were scared it wouldn't. Lots of them were in disbelief that abortion care had become something they had to fight for. And some, like this patient in the baseball cap, were angry. When asked if there was anything she wanted voters to know, she said yes: \"Stop thinking it can't touch you. It could touch you in so many ways. It could be your mother. It could be your sister. It could be your niece. It could be your daughter. Your future, your future daughter. Your future wife. Stop thinking it's not going to touch you, man or woman.\" This story was edited by Carrie Feibel and produced as part of NPR's health reporting partnership with Michigan Radio and Kaiser Health News ( KHN ).", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "health", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [2.564547300338745, 12.002592086791992]}, {"title": "At Guinea's only specialized snake bite clinic, doctors need luck and antivenom", "link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/11/07/1133530892/at-guineas-only-specialized-snake-bite-clinic-doctors-need-luck-and-antivenom", "description": "Life or death in this country's only specialized clinic depends on how fast people can make the arduous trip to get there and the number of doses on hand.", "content": "A researcher hopes to catch an unusual reflection among the trees at night.

About 3,600 people are killed by venomous snakes in Guinea every year, according to the state-sponsored Research Institute of Applied Biology of Guinea (IRBAG). The small West African nation of 13 million people accounts for well over 10% of all such deaths on the continent . Sometimes though, the Guineans bite back. At a bushmeat restaurant in Kindia, the town where the clinic is based, snakes are descaled, boiled and served at about $3 per dish. But this does little to dent the abundance of serpents imperiling local residents.

Guy Peterson for NPR hide caption Herpetologist Alpha Bald\u00e9 and snake catcher Naby Keita, both with the IRBAG, hold down a large forest cobra that was caught in the bedroom of a house after a family called for help. If anything, the number of snake bites appears to be increasing. In response to an urgent request from the Guinean Health Ministry, the World Health Organization took the unprecedented step of dispatching 100 doses of antivenom to the capital, Conakry, in August. It plans to send a further 500 in the coming weeks, according to Mohamed Sankhon, a communications officer with the WHO in Guinea. \"Guinea is like a miniature Africa,\" said Dr. Mamadou Cellou Bald\u00e9 of IRBAG, which houses the clinic. \"We have four biomes: mangroves, mountains, savannah and forests. This provides considerable habitat for different snake species.\" Venomous bites from mambas and cobras account for about 70% of fatalities at the clinic. Bald\u00e9 says that number is likely to increase as the mamba population grows due to deforestation, which has caused the populations of birds of prey \u2014 one of the snakes' only natural predators \u2014 to decline. The other deaths are mostly caused by vipers whose venom can cause patients to blister at the wound and hemorrhage from the eyes and mouth. A viper bite on the leg of a 14 year old girl. If not treated fast enough, viper bites can lead to necrosis and amputation. Guy Peterson for NPR hide caption A viper bite on the leg of a 14 year old girl. If not treated fast enough, viper bites can lead to necrosis and amputation. But no matter the culprit, victims are routinely treated with INOSERP, a polyvalent antivenom developed with collaboration from Professor Bald\u00e9 and his team. Patients are asked to pay 850,000 Guinean francs (about $98) per dose, often indebting themselves to do so. \"I try to reason with the families,\" said Dr. Diallo. \"In our culture, it is customary to organize a ceremony and sacrifice a cow when someone dies. The cost is often double that of lifesaving antivenom.\" Most venomous snake bites require multiple doses of antivenom and practically every patient at the clinic receives at least some free vials from the Asclepius Snake Foundation (ASF), an American-based organization that provides vital clinical and material support to the clinic. No one is sent away. But elsewhere in Guinea, the situation is dire. Of the country's eight regional health centers, the best-stocked has a reserve of just 18 antivenom doses \u2014 half the strength of those at Kindia clinic \u2014 and some have none at all. \"If you take Guinea as a whole, there is obviously a need for way more antivenom than we can provide,\" said Jordan Benjamin, ASF's founder. Most patients travel to the Kindia clinic by motorbike, sandwiched between two family members to keep them steady. The bumpy journey along the country's dirt tracks and potholed roads can take hours \u2014 and a mamba bite can kill within one. Many patients, like Lamourana, are hypothermic by the time they arrive due to the arduous trip out in the elements. Countless others die on the road. Traditional healers remain a fast and cheap, yet dangerous, alternative. In a forest clearing outside Kindia's town center, Papa Daboh gathers bundles of leaves to be crushed and then dried in the sun. He says he inherited the gift of healing from his father and that his patients pay only what they can afford. \"You should mix this powder with water and add lemon juice for flavor,\" he said. \"You will vomit for three days and the venom will exit your body.\" Papa Daboh, a traditional healer, shows off a bundle of leaves he uses to treat snake bites. Traditional healers are still a popular option for people living in remote parts of Guinea who are unable to get to a medical facility or can't afford official health care. This can lead to very serious complications down the line. Guy Peterson for NPR hide caption Papa Daboh, a traditional healer, shows off a bundle of leaves he uses to treat snake bites. Traditional healers are still a popular option for people living in remote parts of Guinea who are unable to get to a medical facility or can't afford official health care. This can lead to very serious complications down the line. Far from purging venom, which travels in the bloodstream, this method only serves to dehydrate and weaken patients, causing a shift in electrolytes and reducing their chances of survival. Other healers are known to make incisions around the puncture marks, applying herbs, dung or charred cow bones to draw out the toxins. This frequently leads to infection, necrosis and amputation, even in cases of nontoxic snake bites. But when Papa Daboh boasts of a 100% success rate, it is possible he is telling the truth. Snakes can take weeks to regenerate metabolically costly venom, meaning they frequently deliver \"dry bites\" in which no venom is released. Humans, who are not considered worthy prey, are regularly on the receiving end of this phenomenon. But not everyone gets lucky. Mohamed Bangoura, 14, was bitten by a black mamba in June. His family took him to a local healer, who served up a concoction to make him vomit. His father, also named Mohamed, was on a work trip in Kindia when he heard the news. \"When the others realized that his health wasn't improving, that is when they sent him [to the clinic],\" he said.

A large forest cobra was found moments later. As Mohamed thrashed around, ripping out his IV, medics said they had to hold him down. Six doses of antivenom later, his vital signs began to stabilize, although his respiratory muscles were exhausted. Close to midnight, he jolted upright and died from a cardiac arrest triggered by what Jordan Benjamin, who was on duty when the boy first came in, described as \"secondary envenomation,\" which is when toxins trapped in tissue around the wound are suddenly released. Mohamed's father said his son was a studious young man with a passion for soccer. \"He was someone that we all thought would go very far,\" he said. Mohamed was the third member of his family to suffer a fatal snake bite within 12 months. \"The worst cases we get at the clinic are people who first went to visit a traditional healer,\" said Dr. Diallo. \"The key thing is that they waste time and delay treatment. The only effective solution is to administer antivenom as soon as possible.\" A forest cobra is harvested for its venom at the Research Institute of Applied Biology of Guinea.

ASF researchers spend their days scouring the bush around the clinic to search for snakes \u2014 an activity that insiders know as \"herping.\" Captured serpents are taken to a lab and administered a dose of ketamine that leaves them slithering drowsily into a corner. Their venom is then extracted for analysis. This data is cross-referenced with clinical records to help better inform medical practice and develop more effective antivenoms. The decades of research since the first antivenom was introduced to Africa in the 1950s was key to saving Lamourana's life. Despite community pressure to stay with a local healer, her family brought her to the clinic almost immediately. After five days of treatment and six doses of INOSERP, she made a full recovery. \"When I was bitten, people told me not to come to the clinic. They told me I would die. Thank God I was brave enough to make the journey,\" she said, before returning home to her herd.

The Post has reached out to Sweeney for comment. The @ElonJet Twitter account has amassed nearly 500,000 followers. Sweeney, a student at the University of Central Florida, created a bot that uses publicly available flight data to track Musk\u2019s private jet as it relocates to different airports. \u201cThank you backing your commitment to free speech. Overwhelmingly the followers of my account are supporters and admirers of your endeavors. Which was my (@JxckSweeney) motivation for creating @ElonJet,\u201d Sweeney tweeted in response to Musk.

Also I\u2019m free to talk about terms of taking down the account peacefully. I just was not happy with previous terms we had discussed . As The Post reported, Musk contacted Sweeney last year through Twitter direct messages and offered him $5,000 to delete the account. The billionaire described the account as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d that could put his life in jeopardy. \u201cI don\u2019t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,\u201d Musk said at the time. Sweeney made a counter-offer of $50,000. Musk said he would consider the offer, but later said it didn\u2019t \u201cfeel right\u201d and stopped responding to his messages. Sweeney parlayed the exchange into other opportunities, including a job offer and merchandise sales. He also operates similar accounts tracking other notable figures, from Bill Gates and other billionaires to Russian oligarchs. The jet-tracking account has also caused other headaches for Musk. In August, the Twitter boss faced a public backlash after the account showed his private jet had completed a nine-minute flight from San Jose to San Francisco.

A hurricane watch has been issued for much of Florida's eastern coast, as officials warned of heavy rainfall and a storm surge from Subtropical Storm Nicole, an unusual, late-season system that could reach hurricane intensity later this week. On Monday, as the storm collected strength east of the Bahamas, officials warned of a \"dangerous storm surge\" of up to 5 feet and heavy rainfall that could affect parts of Florida still recovering from Hurricane Ian, the Category 4 storm that battered much of the state in September . In Florida, the hurricane watch extends from the Volusia-Brevard county line east of Orlando south to Hallandale Beach, between Fort Lauderdale and Miami. The watch also covers Lake Okeechobee and the northern Bahamas. On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for half of the state's counties. \"While this storm does not, at this time, appear that it will become much stronger, I urge all Floridians to be prepared and to listen to announcements from local emergency management officials,\" he said. The storm, which currently has maximum sustained winds of about 45 miles per hour, is expected to near hurricane-level speeds by Wednesday night. At that time, its predicted path will bring the storm over the northern Bahamas, the same islands that were devastated by the Category 5 storm Hurricane Dorian in 2019 . From there, Nicole is forecast to come ashore in Florida between Miami and West Palm Beach late Wednesday or early Thursday. \"Do not focus on the exact track of Nicole since it is expected to be a large storm with hazards extending well to the north of the center, and outside the cone,\" the National Hurricane Center warned Monday . The storm is most likely to reach Florida as \"a top-end tropical storm or a bottom-end hurricane,\" the NHC's Jamie Rhome said in a video forecast Monday. The storm's slow speed and massive size \u2014 extending up to 275 miles out from its center \u2014 mean its effects may be felt across the state. It could dump as much as 6 inches of rain on parts of central and northern Florida, where the impact of flooding from Ian could still be felt last month . Still, even if Nicole does reach hurricane strength, officials emphasized that it will be much weaker than Hurricane Ian. \"We're not forecasting a major hurricane. We're not forecasting rapid intensification at this time,\" Rhome said.

She said Burns has described himself as \"100 percent pro-life at conception\" and that Republicans in Congress are sponsoring a bill that would ban abortion at conception.

DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Iowa authorities say an 18-year-old sex trafficking victim who pleaded guilty to killing a man she said raped her escaped from a women's center where she was serving her probation sentence. Pieper Lewis was seen walking out of the building at the Fresh Start Women's Center in Des Moines shortly after 6:15 a.m. Friday, and at some point that day her GPS monitor was cut off, according to a probation violation report. A warrant was issued for Lewis' arrest and the probation report asked for her deferred judgment to be revoked and have her original sentence imposed, KCCI reported. She could face up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors had called the probation sentence she was given in September merciful for a teen who endured horrible abuse, although some questioned the $150,000 restitution she was ordered to pay. A GoFundMe campaign raised over $560,000 to cover the restitution and pay for her other needs. Polk County Judge David Porter told Lewis that her probation sentence \"was the second chance you asked for. You don't get a third,\" the Des Moines Register reported. If Lewis had successfully completed five years of closely supervised probation her prison sentence would have been expunged. Lewis pleaded guilty last year to involuntary manslaughter and willful injury in the June 2020 killing of 37-year-old Zachary Brooks, a married father of two. Lewis was 15 when she stabbed Brooks more than 30 times in a Des Moines apartment.

Who are the favorites for rookies of the year? Bill Barnwell ranks the candidates.", "content": "We've made it to the halfway point of the NFL season! Your reaction to that news might depend on which team you support. If you're a Jets or Vikings fan, it might feel like the season has flown by. If you're a Packers or Steelers fan, well, you might be wishing that it was already over. The halfway point is a natural time to reflect on what we've seen, and so I'm going to give my award picks for the first half of the NFL season. These aren't my picks for who will win the real hardware at the end of the season, but my (hopefully informed) opinions based on what I've seen from the first nine weeks. In each case, I'll note who I chose for the category in question in my quarter-season awards and give my top three candidates in order. Let's start with Comeback Player of the Year and work our way to MVP: Jump to an award: MVP | Top comeback | Best coach Best rookies: Offense | Defense Players of the Year: Offense | Defense Comeback Player of the Year After Week 4: Saquon Barkley, RB, Giants This felt like a one-person race in the first quarter of the season, with Barkley emerging from years in the wilderness to play like one of the league's best running backs. Barkley hasn't let up, but there's more competition at the midway point. It's dangerous to rely on free agency to add talent, but two of the three players on this list would be considered among the best signings of the offseason. 3. Za'Darius Smith, EDGE, Vikings I don't want to say Smith was written off, but there were legitimate concerns that the former Packers star was past his prime. He played only 18 snaps last season before missing the rest of 2022 with a knee ailment, and when the Ravens wanted to sign him this offseason, their doctors wouldn't sign off on the deal. The Vikings ended up inking him to what is essentially a one-year deal for less than $7 million. Even if Smith spent the second half of the season ice fishing, he already has delivered more than what the Vikings paid. He has 8.5 sacks and 12 knockdowns through eight games, including three sacks against the Cardinals in Week 8. Minnesota has been able to use him on the edge and isolate him on the interior against overmatched guards and centers. With a limited secondary, he has been essential for the 7-1 Vikings. 2. Geno Smith, QB, Seahawks I'm not really sure what Smith came back from besides people writing him off as a replacement-level passer, but in terms of surprising veterans, he has to be on this list. As much as the Seahawks would like to pretend they knew this would happen all along, he wasn't even on the Seattle roster when the team traded quarterback Russell Wilson in March, netting Drew Lock as part of the return. Anyone could have signed Smith in free agency, but the former Jets starter returned to Seattle right before the draft in April. After winning a preseason competition against Lock for the job, Smith has exceeded even the wildest expectations. He leads the league in completion percentage (73.1%) and completion percentage over expectation (plus-7.1%). He's averaging nearly 8 yards per attempt and ranks ninth in expected points added (EPA) per dropback. The Seahawks have thrown more aggressively than I expected, and Smith has rewarded them. His season is more of a delayed breakout than a comeback, but either way, he has been one of the best stories -- and most valuable players -- in the NFL. 1. Saquon Barkley, RB, Giants A more traditional candidate, Barkley looks like a transformative player after three years of being slowed by ankle and knee injuries. He looks much closer to the player we saw as a rookie, but this time around, he's the focal point for a Giants team that is actually winning games and competing for a playoff berth. We can lean on the advanced metrics from NFL Next Gen Stats to help tell the story. Let's use rush yards over expectation (RYOE), which measures how many yards a running back gains versus what an average back would expect to gain with the same blockers against the same players on defense. Barkley averaged 1.1 RYOE per carry as a rookie. After dropping to 0.6 RYOE in 2019 and posting minus-0.3 RYOE in both 2020 and 2021, he's back up to 1.1 RYOE in 2022. Of course, Barkley has managed to time some of his biggest plays for key fourth-quarter moments. He broke a tackle on the 2-point attempt that gave the Giants a win over the Titans in the opener. His biggest catch of the season, a 41-yarder against the Packers, helped set up his game-winning touchdown. Runs of 13, 18 and 20 yards in the final quarter against the Jaguars set up a comeback victory. It's impossible to imagine the Giants thriving in the NFC East without Barkley. Coach of the Year After Week 4: Nick Sirianni, Eagles The good news is there are only six realistic candidates for this award. The bad news is they could all credibly win. I was ready to put Mike Vrabel in the Hall of Fame, as his Titans were winning for most of the game in Kansas City with Malik Willis at quarterback, only for Patrick Mahomes to eventually pull out the victory with his legs. His Titans, riddled with injuries and left for dead after an 0-2 start, are 5-3 and continue to find ways to compete every week. Guys like Vrabel -- excellent coaches who have been around for extended periods of time -- almost never win this award. It's also why Pete Carroll probably won't get much consideration, but who thought the Seahawks would be 6-3 after Week 9? The offense has led the way, but Carroll is getting the most out of players such as cornerback Tariq Woolen and edge rusher Uchenna Nwosu, and he deserves credit for being forward-thinking and pass-friendly on offense with Geno Smith at quarterback. The Seahawks look like a legitimate playoff team. 3. Robert Saleh, Jets It's even more difficult to keep out Kevin O'Connell, who has the Vikings at 7-1 with a prohibitive lead with the NFC North. O'Connell is the exact sort of coach who would typically win this award in real life, too. Given that the Vikings have essentially spent the entire season winning coin flips in one-score games, though, I'm not quite as taken by Minnesota as their record suggests. Instead, I'll go for the coach who was last seen slowing down the much-vaunted Bills offense in the Meadowlands. Saleh and the Jets benefited from playing a string of backup quarterbacks earlier in this season, but Gang Green manhandled Aaron Rodgers in Lambeau, and they just took out the rival Bills in New Jersey on Sunday. After a rough start to the season, Saleh has the Jets' defense playing extremely well. From Week 3 onward, it ranks number two in EPA allowed per snap (minus-0.10), fourth in points per drive allowed (1.47) and third in red zone possessions allowed per game (2.4). I'm not sure about second-year quarterback Zach Wilson -- and the offense sorely misses its injured personnel -- but Saleh has turned around this defense. 2. Mike McDaniel, Dolphins McDaniel's 6-3 Dolphins aren't undefeated, but they've won every game quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has both started and finished this season. Tagovailoa is playing better than he has before in the NFL by a significant margin, and while adding wideout Tyreek Hill to the mix goes a long way, remember that he could barely stay upright behind Miami's offensive line before McDaniel arrived. Miami would have the league's second-best offense by EPA per play if we only include the games Tagovailoa has started. The Dolphins' most recent three-game winning streak has come against middling competition in the Steelers, Lions and Bears, but Tagovailoa & Co. also picked up dramatic victories earlier in the season against the Ravens and Bills. I'm not sure any other coach in this tier has two equally impressive wins, although the Jets joined the Dolphins in beating the Bills on Sunday. 1. Nick Sirianni, Eagles I'm simple. Until the Eagles lose a game, I don't think it's possible for anyone to knock Sirianni out of the top spot. The former Colts assistant was a viable candidate last season, when he helped lead an Eagles team that had gone 4-11-1 in 2020 to a 9-8 record and a playoff berth. After an active offseason, many likely expected them to take another step forward in 2022. An 8-0 start wasn't anticipated, though. Quarterback Jalen Hurts continues to flourish under Sirianni's tutelage, and in a season with so many one-score games, it's a testament to Philadelphia's dominance that it hasn't been involved in many close contests. The Eagles have had only two games decided by seven points or fewer; one was a game against the Lions that required two fourth-quarter touchdowns to get close, the other was a 20-17 victory over the Cardinals. Some factors out of Sirianni's control have helped. The Eagles have been one of the league's healthiest teams. They've played the easiest schedule in the league, per ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI) and project to face the easiest schedule moving forward. At the end of the day, though, 8-0 is 8-0. When you're the coach of the league's only undefeated team, you're the Coach of the Year. Defensive Rookie of the Year After Week 4: Devin Lloyd, LB, Jaguars The defensive awards usually favor pass-rushers over players at other positions, but the only candidate who figures into the discussion for Defensive Rookie of the Year in that category is Aidan Hutchinson, whose 4.5 sacks on the season were supplemented by a critical goal-line interception of Aaron Rodgers on Sunday. I will admit that the idea of nominating somebody from the Lions defense, as good as they were against the Packers on Sunday, seems a little too aggressive. After Week 4, my third-place finisher was Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson, who misses out this time around. I kept a big name out of the voting then, but I have to get him back in the mix as both he and his team have rounded into form: 3. Devin Lloyd, LB, Jaguars The Jaguars have struggled on defense, but Lloyd looks like a building block, along with edge rusher Josh Allen and cornerback Tyson Campbell. Lloyd already looks comfortable in pass defense and in working to take away passing lanes in zone coverage. After defending six passes in two games earlier this season, he didn't have another pass breakup until Sunday, when he nearly intercepted Derek Carr in the first quarter against the Raiders. Lloyd also came up with his second quarterback knockdown in as many weeks and recovered the fumble on Vegas' \"pitchy pitchy woo woo\" attempt on the game's final play, sealing Jacksonville's first win in more than a month. Lloyd has also been as advertised as a run defender; his 30 stops (plays which create negative EPA for the offense) are tied for fourth most in the league. 2. Tariq Woolen, CB, Seahawks If you're wondering why DeAndre Hopkins disappeared from Sunday's game for most of the final three quarters, you've come to the right place. While it was a team effort against Arizona's star wideout, Woolen is the primary cornerback on the right side of the defense for the Seahawks, which meant plenty of Hopkins. Hopkins caught a touchdown pass on a crosser while Woolen was in zone coverage on another player, but he finished with just four catches on five targets for 36 yards. Teams have been more aggressive challenging Woolen, but they haven't liked the results. The 6-foot-4 corner has the length to challenge any contestable pass and the speed to run with just about any wide receiver. He's allowing only 6.8 yards per attempt in his direction, per NFL Next Gen Stats, which is below league average. He already has four interceptions and eight pass knockdowns, with the former mark second in the NFL behind Philadelphia's C.J. Gardner-Johnson. It's a mystery how the player out of UTSA fell to the fifth round of April's draft, but the Seahawks aren't complaining. 1. Sauce Gardner, CB, Jets Maybe it's recency bias, but I find it impossible to keep Gardner out of the top spot. Since a slow start to the season, the Jets have been wildly impressive on defense. While part of that owes to a series of games against backup quarterbacks, you obviously can't make that same claim after seeing what Robert Saleh's team did to the Bills on Sunday. Buffalo mustered just 17 points on nine drives, with the Jets forcing him into two interceptions. Gardner gave up a big play early in the game to Stefon Diggs, but the rookie corner lured Allen into a hole shot that Josh Allen immediately regretted. Gardner's second interception of the season set up the Jets with a short field, which turned into a crucial second touchdown. What Gardner has done as a rookie is special. He leads the league with 13 passes defensed. As the nearest defender in coverage, per NFL Next Gen Stats, he has generated 26.3 EPA. The only other cornerback in the league above 20 EPA is Philadelphia's James Bradberry, who is barely ahead of Gardner. If the hope is the No. 4 overall pick is the next Darrelle Revis, well, he's ahead of the curve; Gardner is playing better than Revis did as a rookie. Offensive Rookie of the Year Pick after Week 4: Chris Olave, WR, Saints I thought there was going to be some churn in the top three here, but the same three players I highlighted after Week 4 are in the mix at the halfway point. Breece Hall would have made his way into the top three, but the promising young Jets running back tore his ACL in Week 7 and will miss the remainder of the season. If Hall had stayed healthy, he would have been in the running to lead this group. Likewise, Kenneth Walker could be the pick at the end of the year. Few backs of any vintage have been better than the Seahawks standout over the past four weeks of the season, during which he has run for 424 yards and a league-high six touchdowns. At the same time, though, he was basically a backup for the first month. If Walker keeps this up, those first four weeks won't seem like a big deal. Here, since we're looking back from the halfway point, that first month represents nearly half of the year. I would love to include an offensive lineman, but I'm not sure anybody is as impressive as, say, left tackle Rashawn Slater was for the Chargers last season. Center Tyler Linderbaum has been fun for the Ravens. Tight end Greg Dulcich has been impressive since returning from injured reserve for the Broncos. Wideouts George Pickens (Steelers) and Romeo Doubs (Packers) have flashed, although Doubs was hurt in Sunday's loss to the Lions. In terms of first-half production, however, there's a clear big three among the rookies: 3. Dameon Pierce, RB, Texans Pierce has been Houston's best player on offense for most of this season, which is rare for fourth-round picks to pull off in their rookie campaigns. He has succeeded despite the struggles of the passing attack, which makes his production even more impressive. Consider Thursday's game against the Eagles, when quarterback Davis Mills struggled and needed garbage time to get to 154 yards. Pierce's 27 carries produced 139 yards, and the Texans had more first downs on the ground (10) than they did through the air (eight). The Texans are a better run-blocking line than you might think, but Pierce is getting more than what's blocked. The 22-year-old has generated 118 RYOE and five first downs over expectation (FDOE). The latter mark ranks third among running backs, behind only Nick Chubb and Josh Jacobs. The 75-yard run Pierce broke off against the Chargers is probably a bit of an outlier given his speed, but Pierce is physical between the tackles and has offered more in the passing game than his college profile would have suggested. He's a legitimate building block for the Texans. 2. Garrett Wilson, WR, Jets Wilson appears to be heating up. After his incredible game in the comeback victory over the Browns in Week 2, he went quiet for a few weeks before turning back on over the past two weeks. The No. 10 overall pick had six catches for 115 yards against the Patriots last week, then followed with eight catches for 92 yards on nine targets against the Bills on Sunday. Over the past two weeks, the only wideouts who have averaged more yards per route run than Wilson are superstars: Tyreek Hill, A.J. Brown, Stefon Diggs, Jaylen Waddle and Cooper Kupp. There aren't many wide receivers who have Wilson's footwork and change of direction in cramped quarters. He already is a weekly threat to do something embarrassing to a cornerback that ends up going viral. Across the entire season, despite playing with Joe Flacco and Zach Wilson, he has averaged an even 2.0 yards per route run, which is tied with DK Metcalf for 18th among wideouts. Wilson already is a good player for what looks like a promising Jets draft class. 1. Chris Olave, WR, Saints Even without Monday night's game against the Ravens on the books, Olave rates as the best rookie wide receiver from this class. His 2.5 yards per route run places him seventh among all wideouts, nestled between Cooper Kupp and CeeDee Lamb. And while Wilson has been working with Wilson and Flacco, Olave has been targeted by Andy Dalton, Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill. Better, maybe, but it's not as if Olave has been working with prime Drew Brees. What's really striking about Olave is how quickly he has become a multilevel threat in the passing game. We've been spoiled in recent years by Odell Beckham Jr. and Justin Jefferson and how quickly they were able to turn into No. 1 receivers during their rookie seasons, but Olave has been an option for everything from third-down slants to contested catches down the sideline. With Michael Thomas out for the season and his Saints future in question, Olave has taken over as the lead receiver. There are lots of fair questions about whether the Saints should have been so aggressive this offseason, but Olave is everything they could have hoped for so far. Defensive Player of the Year Pick after Week 4: Nick Bosa, EDGE, 49ers Whether you want to blame the award jinx or the sad realities of playing for the 49ers, Bosa immediately went down injured in Week 5. He missed most of the Panthers game and the following week's loss to the Falcons. He has come back with 2.5 sacks over the ensuing two games, but he doesn't have quite the same sort of edge-rushing lead over the competition he possessed after Week 4. Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who was second on that list, also missed his team's game in Week 6. All this does, sadly, is make an impossible vote even more difficult. New England's Matthew Judon has spent the past month living in opposing backfields and now leads the league with 11.5 sacks. Myles Garrett has been devastating when healthy. Aaron Donald continues to change games on a weekly basis and nearly won the game on Sunday for the Rams. Za'Darius Smith has sparked the Vikings. Trey Hendrickson's advanced numbers stand out. Quinnen Williams is having a career year. Sauce Gardner could be a rookie candidate. There are three or four Eagles having All-Pro seasons. This one isn't fair. 3. Pat Surtain II, CB, Broncos With apologies to Gardner and Jalen Ramsey, no cornerback is playing better right now than the second-year superstar in Denver. Burdened by their disastrous offense, the Broncos' defensive performance has been lost in the shuffle. Despite losing key players such as Randy Gregory and Justin Simmons for stretches, they lead the league in defensive DVOA and pass defense DVOA. They rank second in EPA per play and QBR allowed. Coordinator Ejiro Evero's unit is more than holding up their end of the bargain. Their best player is Surtain, who has been locking down his wideouts. Per Pro Football Reference, Surtain is allowing only 4.0 yards per target, which ranks behind only James Bradberry among cornerbacks. NFL Next Gen Stats suggest Surtain has allowed only 0.6 yards per snap, which is the third-best mark. Teams don't like targeting Surtain, and when they do, they don't get much. About the only hole you can poke in his performance is a lack of takeaways; he has no interceptions and just one forced fumble as the Broncos hit their bye. 2. Nick Bosa, EDGE, 49ers Without the missing game and a half, Bosa would still be No. 1 on this list. As it is, he is still tied for second in the NFL with 8.5 sacks and paces the NFL with 20 knockdowns. Doing this with the missing time and a bye week under his belt makes Bosa even all that more remarkable. He also is an excellent run defender, which makes his presence on this list essential. 1. Micah Parsons, EDGE, Cowboys Outside of Donald, I'm not sure any defensive player scares opposing teams more than Parsons. You can understand why. The raw numbers are great, as his eight sacks and 14 quarterback knockdowns rank among the league leaders. Parsons also has nine tackles for loss, two forced fumbles and the fumble recovery he took to the house against the Bears in Week 8. That alone would be enough to get Parsons in the discussion. The advanced metrics make a case that Parsons is even more valuable. He leads the league with 36 pressures. Among the guys with at least 15 pressures, the only player who creates their average pressure as quickly as Parsons is Donald, who isn't supposed to be on a level with anybody else. Parsons also is coming from around the edge more often than Donald, which makes that comparison even more impressive. Nobody has a better pass rush win rate on the edge (32.4%) or against single-teams (42.7%) than Parsons, who typically draws double-teams, chips or offensive lines slid in his direction. This creates opportunities for other pass-rushers. Parsons has managed to make a difference on plays where he doesn't get home, as the 18 incompletions he's forced are second in the league behind Hendrickson. I started this analysis thinking Parsons was in the mix at edge rusher, but after a closer look, I don't think anybody is making more of an impact in as wide of a variety of ways. Offensive Player of the Year Pick after Week 4: Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins As always, since quarterbacks have a stranglehold on the MVP award, I use the Offensive Player of the Year trophy to honor a player who doesn't throw (too many) passes. And here, it's easy to start by eliminating some options. There are sadly no offensive lineman I feel comfortable nominating, and injuries to virtually every notable tight end have kept them from dominating over the entire first half. Travis Kelce is the lone holdout, as the future Hall of Famer continues an impossible run of health at one of the league's highest-attrition positions. The Chiefs star just misses out here to a pair of wide receivers and the best running back. 3. Stefon Diggs, WR, Bills Diggs falls from second to third, as his efficiency metrics have slipped ever so slightly toward Justin Jefferson and A.J. Brown. There's nothing wrong with being ahead of stars, of course, and Diggs continues to be incredible. While Sunday was a frustrating game for the Bills, he helped create Buffalo's first scoring opportunity of the day by beating Sauce Gardner on a double move for 42 yards. (Josh Allen then threw an interception to eliminate that scoring opportunity. The scary thing is that a five-catch, 93-yard performance might qualify as a down afternoon from Diggs, who already has five 100-yard games under his belt through the first eight games of the season. In an offense which throws the ball as much as anybody in the league and hasn't seen secondary players such as Gabe Davis and Dawson Knox take another step forward into stardom, Diggs is often asked to be the solution for Allen. He comes through more often than not. 2. Nick Chubb, RB, Browns I have Chubb just ahead of the two runner-up candidates at running back, Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs. Henry leads the league in rushing yards after a 115-yard game against the Chiefs on Sunday night, but it has taken him 34 additional carries to rack up his 29-yard lead. Jacobs has been nearly as efficient as Chubb, but Chubb has 98 additional rushing yards on just 11 more attempts than his Raiders counterpart. Chubb also leads the league with 10 rushing touchdowns. By advanced metrics, it's less of a contest. Chubb's 276 RYOE are 78 more than any other player and way ahead of both Henry (113) and Jacobs (119). Chubb's ability to break down loaded boxes and short-yardage situations are the stuff of legend; his 12 FDOE are twice that of any other player. Henry has looked like the prime version of himself over the last two weeks, but Chubb has looked and played like peak Henry all season. The only hole you can poke in Chubb's game is a lack of receiving work, but nobody compares to the 26-year-old as a runner. 1. Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins The problem for Chubb is that Hill might have an even larger lead over the rest of the competition. While he has played nine games and most of his competitors are at eight, Hill's 1,104 receiving yards are 237 ahead of the next-nearest receiver, Jefferson. Hill also leads the league in catches (76) and first downs (48), although his leads in those categories aren't quite as dramatic. Where Hill really separates, though, is efficiency. Halfway through the year, he is commanding the league's second-highest target share (36.0%) and generating a whopping 4.0 yards per route run. To put that in context, ESPN has data going back through 2007 on receivers. No qualifying receiver has ever averaged more than 3.6 yards per route run through the first half of the season. The only guy to average more than 3.5 yards per route run over the first nine weeks of the season is Rob Gronkowski in 2016, and he missed two games with injuries. Hill averages more yards every time he runs a route than Randy Moss did in 2007. If there's any hole you can poke, it's touchdowns, as Hill has only three. He added his third to that list with a score against the Bears on Sunday. As it stands, he already has four 150-plus yardage games this season, which is one behind the NFL record of five. With all apologies to Roy Green, Jerry Rice, Tim Brown and Antonio Brown, Hill might be setting a record by the end of the campaign. Most Valuable Player Pick after Week 4: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs I don't think there are any non-quarterbacks who make this MVP race, although Tyreek Hill and Micah Parsons could come close. When I drew this list up last time, I had to struggle with seven candidates. Two of them played their way off the list, as Trevor Lawrence has been a mess in the red zone before Sunday's win over the Raiders, while Lamar Jackson hasn't been consistent as a passer over the past month. Jackson and Lawrence rank 17th and 22nd, respectively, in QBR from Week 5-on. Geno Smith 's accuracy remains his advantage on the competition, as he leads the league in most accuracy-related statistics. He also is fourth in the league in QBR (68.0) and sixth in yards per attempt (7.8) among qualifying passers. As a passer, I don't know if there's anyone throwing the ball quite as well as Smith has this season with maybe one exception that I'll get to in a moment. The case against Smith just narrowly keeps him out of the top three. He takes sacks at a rate slightly above league average, and the pick-six he threw on a swing pass Sunday helped push his EPA per dropback to 0.06, which ranks ninth among qualifying passers. He can run and has picked up a number of key first downs on the ground over the past few weeks, but he doesn't offer the same sort of rushing impact as the top three candidates. If we're talking about quarterback play on a snap-by-snap basis, Tua Tagovailoa has been the league's best passer. It's not even close. Tagovailoa leads the league in QBR (79.1), yards per attempt (9.2), EPA per dropback (0.34), passer rating (115.9) and first down rate (43.1%). Those are five significant measures of quarterback play with varying levels of complexity or modernity, and Tagovailoa leads the way in each. Throw in the late-game heroics in the comeback win over the Ravens and he even has a signature win. The problem is that Tagovailoa missed 2\u00bd games after suffering a concussion against the Bengals in Week 4. That's the equivalent of missing nearly five games over the course of a 17-game season, and it's not realistic for a player to miss that sort of playing time and still win MVP. Odell Beckham Jr. missed four full games in his rookie season in 2014 and came back to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, but even one extra game might have been a bridge too far. If Tagovailoa continues to play at this level and stays healthy the rest of the way, he could win MVP despite those gaps on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, especially because the Dolphins went 0-3 while he was sidelined. And while he has raised his level of play dramatically from previous seasons, outside of a few dropped interceptions, there's nothing in his performance suggesting it's a fluke or unsustainable. 3. Josh Allen, QB, Bills It might seem like a reaction to Sunday's loss to the Jets, but as good as Allen has been at times, turnovers and sloppy play are legitimate concerns for the Buffalo offense. The Bills went through these same issues in the Week 8 victory over the Packers, when Allen threw two interceptions on Green Bay's side of the field in the fourth quarter, including one on the 3-yard line. They had already done enough that day to beat an overmatched Packers team, but the Jets were good enough on defense to keep things close. Allen's second interception set up New York with a short field for what ended up becoming a crucial touchdown. Allen has eight interceptions and seven fumbles this season. The latter mark is the fifth most of any quarterback. The former means Allen's interception rate ranks 26th out of 35 passers. He has thrown interceptions more often this season than the likes of Baker Mayfield and Carson Wentz. It's not a problem in the broader sense, since any coach would obviously trade a few interceptions for what he can do as a player, but it does inspire negative comparisons between Allen and the other players in this stratosphere. Obviously, Allen is capable of generating obscene amounts of value through his arm and legs. With the Jets slowing down the passing attack Sunday, he ran for seven first downs, including both of Buffalo's touchdowns. Nobody in the league has his upside, and he realizes that upside more often than ever before these days. It's also fair to note that turnovers have been an issue, they cost the Bills a victory in Week 9. 2. Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles 1. Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs Allen had the greatest Year 3 jump in recent football history, but Hurts is beginning to challenge that title. As a passer, he can credibly challenge the guy ahead of him on this list. He has a better completion percentage and more yards per attempt than Mahomes. Hurts' Eagles are the most efficient offense in football before they shut down in garbage time; when both teams in a game have a win expectancy of at least 10%, the Eagles score 3.3 points per possession, which is more than any other team. Hurts is the maestro of that attack, and the offense is built around his talents. So, why is Hurts second and Mahomes first? Let's start on the ground. Hurts has nearly twice as many rushing yards (326) as Mahomes (176), and while the Chiefs star just ran in his first touchdown of the season in the win over the Titans, Hurts already has six rushing scores on the books. This is a huge area of advantage for Hurts, right? Not quite. Mahomes doesn't run anywhere near as often as Hurts, but he has been a more efficient runner when afforded the opportunity. Hurts has generated 22.2 rushing EPA and 326 rushing yards on 88 carries. He averages just 3.7 yards per rush. While Mahomes has run only 27 times, he averages 6.5 yards per carry and has generated 17.1 rushing EPA, which is nearly as much as Hurts has made on more than three times as many carries. As a passer, meanwhile, Hurts has been slightly more efficient by completion percentage and yards per attempt, but Mahomes has generated far more volume. Mahomes has thrown 330 passes to Hurts' 239. That's partly because the Eagles have held big leads in the second half and have chosen to run the ball, but the added volume generates additional value for Mahomes. Hurts also takes sacks at one of the league's highest rates, while Mahomes is much better about getting rid of the football. In terms of passing EPA, Mahomes has generated more than twice as much passing EPA (88.7) in 2022 as Hurts (42.0). Hurts is a reasonable pick as the starting quarterback of the league's last undefeated team, and he is producing exactly what the coaching staff wants from him on a week-to-week basis this season. Mahomes, however, has been the most valuable quarterback in the league.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-26.44084930419922, -9.595699310302734]}, {"title": "Mystery teams, All-Americans and other national predictions for 2022-23", "link": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/34964494/men-final-four-picks-other-national-predictions-2022-23?device=featurephone", "description": "From bracket disruptors to Wooden Award candidates not named Tshiebwe or Timme, ESPN's experts make their final men's college basketball national predictions before the season tips off.", "content": "Seven months ago, Kansas entered the locker room at halftime in the national title game facing a double-digit deficit against North Carolina. Something happened within that room, because Kansas then launched one of the great turnarounds in title-game history, cut down the nets, and the 2021-22 season was over. A lot has changed in college basketball since then. Nearly 2,000 players entered the transfer portal and restructured rosters around the country. The retirements of Jay Wright and Mike Krzyzewski have begun a new chapter for two of the game's powerhouses. Expansion rumors continue to percolate, and it's unclear how the game's hierarchy will look in the future. That all sets the stage for a 2022-23 campaign full of mysteries. Sure, Oscar Tshiebwe and Drew Timme return, and North Carolina is an obvious favorite to win the national title. But we don't know much more beyond that. After six weeks of previewing the season -- including discussing the strengths and weaknesses of every Power 5 conference, the AAC and the mid-majors -- ESPN's Myron Medcalf, Jeff Borzello, John Gasaway and Joe Lunardi make their final predictions. Let the fun begin. 2022-23 NATIONAL PREDICTIONS FOR ... The most interesting team Medcalf: It feels safe to assume UCLA's marriage to the Pac-12 will end in turmoil. During Pac-12 media day, league commissioner George Kliavkoff said he didn't know anyone in favor of the Bruins' move to the Big Ten -- putting coach Mick Cronin and his players in a bad spot that day. The drama could continue throughout the season, especially if the preseason league title pick lives up to the hype. Meanwhile, Jaime Jaquez Jr. is finally healthy, five-star prospect Amari Bailey has arrived and Tyger Campbell is one of America's top point guards. UCLA is must-see TV this year. Borzello: Duke is always a storyline entering the season. But Mike Krzyzewski is no longer on the sideline, replaced by Jon Scheyer after more than 40 years in Durham. And, Duke brings in the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, while returning just one player (Jeremy Roach) who saw a real role last season. There are a lot of questions, but also high expectations and a ton of talent. Gasaway: The last time we saw Kentucky, the Wildcats lost to a No. 15 seed. Now, they're KenPom's preseason No. 1. For the first time in coach John Calipari's tenure, two seasons have come and gone without the program reaching the second weekend of the tournament. That reigning Wooden Award winner Oscar Tshiebwe is still here proves college has become a big man's game ... right? Or do the past two national champions suggest otherwise? Lunardi: It will have been seven years without a call when Indiana sees its name on Selection Sunday. Now, in just his second season, Mike Woodson has the Hoosiers in position to end up atop the Big Ten and play deep into March. Woodson came home for this; star Trayce Jackson-Davis came back for this. Could Indiana really make the Final Four for the first time this century? Why not? The \"mystery team\" that will be either a bracket disruptor or a tournament disaster Lunardi: Dayton will begin its 2020 COVID revenge tour with point guard Malachi Smith sidelined by an ankle injury. Not great, but better than cancelling the NCAA tournament on a presumptive No. 1 seed and best team in school history. Smith will be back, center DaRon Holmes II will do a credible Obi Toppin imitation and the Flyers will not be \"first team out\" of the 2023 field. This season, the \"D\" in Dayton stands for disruptor. Gasaway: Iowa. We've seen the \"disaster\" part. The Hawkeyes were out of the tournament by late afternoon on the first Thursday of the 2022 tournament, courtesy of No. 12 seed Richmond. But laptops yet again absolutely love this 2022-23 offense. Plus, Kris Murray is a preseason All-Big Ten selection despite starting just once last season. The aforementioned laptops are yet again wary of Iowa's defense, though. The Hawkeyes could shock a No. 1 seed in the round of 32 or pull another 2022. Borzello: Auburn was one of the nation's big surprises last season, winning the SEC and even rising all the way to No. 1 in the polls in late January. The Tigers have the talent to compete near the top of the league again -- but also have a backcourt that was highly inconsistent and struggled with decision-making last season. And now they don't have Jabari Smith and Walker Kessler to bail them out. Can Wendell Green Jr. and K.D. Johnson take a step forward? Can Yohan Traore and Johni Broome replace the outgoing first-rounders? Medcalf: Purdue. There's a scenario in which national player of the year candidate Zach Edey and a bunch of new guards, including David Jenkins Jr. (40% from 3 at Utah last season), could blend and be a dangerous group ready for a run in March. There's also the chance the Boilermakers could get into the NCAA tournament and face a veteran team that bounces them out. The first top-25 team to exit the NCAA tournament Gasaway: Oregon missed the tournament last season and returns less than half of its possession minutes. Will Richardson is outstanding. Landing national top-10 recruit Kel'el Ware was an exceptionally nice get for coach Dana Altman. Still, it's not entirely clear how this particular rotation is expected, or expecting, to excel. Medcalf: Illinois. I think Brad Underwood always finds a way to regroup, and adding Terrence Shannon Jr. and Matthew Mayer is certainly a boost. But the loss of Kofi Cockburn, one of the most imposing players in college basketball for the past two years, leaves one of the sport's greatest voids. I could see this team being fairly vulnerable once the NCAA tournament begins. Lunardi: No one has admired Villanova's decade of excellence more than this St. Joe's guy. But does any school get John Wooden twice? The loss of Jay Wright is massive. The Achilles injury suffered by Justin Moore was only seven months ago. The Big East has multiple challengers to Villanova's throne. All due respect to new coach Kyle Neptune, who has hit all the right notes in succeeding Wright, but the Wildcats have only one way to go. Borzello: Michigan, the only AP preseason top 25 team I don't have in my top 25 heading into the season. The Wolverines bring back just one starter from a team that finished 19-15 last season (albeit one that made the Sweet 16 as an 11-seed), and don't bring in any surefire lottery picks or game-changing talent. I love Hunter Dickinson, but coach Juwan Howard will have to figure out a lot of things with the rest of his roster. The player not named Tshiebwe or Timme who could challenge for the Wooden Award Lunardi: I already mentioned the potential impact of Trayce Jackson-Davis. The 6-9 sophomore is the likely Big Ten Player of the Year. Why not take it one step further if the Hoosiers can pull off a storybook Final Four season? Borzello: Armando Bacot. It's not all that creative of an answer, but the best player on the preseason No. 1 team in the country? I'll take a shot on that any day. Bacot is dominant on the interior. He averaged 16 and 13 last season, then upped his game in the NCAA tournament, averaging 15.3 points and 16.5 rebounds -- including two games of 20-plus rebounds. Ridiculous numbers. If he does close to that for a full season ... Medcalf: If Zach Edey's numbers grow -- from 14.4 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 1.2 BPG in 19.0 MPG last season -- when his minutes increase, he'll be a strong candidate. He'll be the anchor for Purdue, which has produced four AP All-Americans since 2011. Gasaway: Max Abmas. He's the nation's third-leading returning scorer, and there's a fair chance Abmas will launch 300 3-point attempts this season. What if they fall? Enough of these all-conference teams with four centers. Keep an eye on the Oral Roberts scoring machine listed at 6-foot-0. The storyline to watch Borzello: The returning bigs. And it's not just Oscar Tshiebwe, Drew Timme, Armando Bacot, Hunter Dickinson and Trayce Jackson-Davis. The depth at the position is remarkable this season. Adama Sanogo is going to be great again. Zach Edey might be the most dominant inside scorer in the country. Colin Castleton is fantastic at both ends of the floor. Ryan Kalkbrenner is incredibly underrated. DaRon Holmes II is ready to have a huge season. Oh, and the No. 1 recruit in the ESPN 100 was Duke center Dereck Lively. There will be high-level individual matchups at the position all season. Gasaway: The changing game. Will UCLA and USC really join the Big Ten? (Not if our colleague Bill Walton can help it!) What about Gonzaga and the Big 12? Is tournament expansion really on the table, or is it just talk? Will there be a 24-second clock? Does the selection committee really have to live forever? It's been a good 40-odd years with a 60-something-team tournament, shifting conferences and progressively longer 3-point lines and shorter shot clocks. What's next? Medcalf: A Gonzaga move to the Big 12 would not only shift college basketball, but it would enlarge the divide between the major conferences and everybody else. But it would also create more questions about the future of the Pac-12. The Big 12 continues to feel like the league with the most potential to become a third superconference. If that unfolds this year, and the transfer portal continues to grow, it's fair to wonder if college basketball's non-Power 5 leagues will simply become college basketball's G League in a new era. Lunardi: The drumbeat for NCAA tournament expansion will grow louder. It's not a terrible idea, provided it's done modestly -- as in, not 96 teams -- and sensibly. There are ways to address both the power conference schools on the at-large side and preserve the obvious place for automatic qualifiers in America's greatest sporting event. And if the men's basketball committee can't figure it out, yours truly is just a phone call away. 2022-23 PICKS 2023 FINAL FOUR PICKS (* denotes your pick for the national champion) Medcalf: North Carolina*, Houston, Kentucky, UCLA Borzello: North Carolina*, Houston, Baylor, UCLA Gasaway: Baylor*, Tennessee, Houston, Duke Lunardi: Kentucky*, Indiana, Virginia, Creighton WOODEN AWARD (PLAYER OF THE YEAR) PICKS Medcalf: Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Borzello: Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Gasaway: Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Lunardi: Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky NEWCOMER OF THE YEAR PICKS Medcalf: Nick Smith Jr., Arkansas Borzello: Nick Smith Jr., Arkansas Gasaway: Nick Smith Jr., Arkansas Lunardi: Dereck Lively II, Duke COACH OF THE YEAR PICKS Medcalf: Mick Cronin, UCLA Borzello: Rick Barnes, Tennessee Gasaway: Jamie Dixon, TCU Lunardi: Mike Woodson, Indiana ALL-AMERICA TEAM PICKS Medcalf: Marcus Sasser, Houston Max Abmas, Oral Roberts Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Drew Timme, Gonzaga Armando Bacot, North Carolina Borzello: Nick Smith Jr., Arkansas Marcus Sasser, Houston Drew Timme, Gonzaga Armando Bacot, North Carolina Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Gasaway: Max Abmas, Oral Roberts Nick Smith Jr., Arkansas Marcus Sasser, Houston Hunter Maldonado, Wyoming Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky Lunardi: Marcus Sasser, Houston Trayce Jackson-Davis, Indiana Drew Timme, Gonzaga Armando Bacot, North Carolina Oscar Tshiebwe, Kentucky", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-23.00617027282715, -3.9287872314453125]}, {"title": "Washington Post fact-check blasts Biden with \u2018Bottomless Pinocchio\u2019 rating", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/washington-post-rates-biden-with-bottomless-pinocchio/", "description": "The Washington Post crowned President Biden with its Trump-era \"bottomless Pinocchio\" rating after he told multiple untruths and committed several gaffes ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Washington Post crowned President Biden Monday with its Trump-era \u201c bottomless Pinocchio \u201d rating after he told multiple untruths and committed several gaffes ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. It\u2019s the first time the newspaper has \u201cawarded\u201d Biden the not-so-coveted rating, which it defines as a statement repeated at least 20 times that is so false that it has received either \u201cthree Pinocchios\u201d or \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d on prior occasions. The statement in question is Biden\u2019s oft-repeated claim that he has spent \u201cmore time with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping than any other head of state ,\u201d traveling \u201c17,000 miles with him.\u201d The statement has been proven false, with the White House in February 2021 telling the newspaper it was \u201ca reference to the total travel back and forth \u2014 both internally in the US and China, and as well as internationally \u2014 for meetings they held together.\u201d But even that claim proved to be inaccurate. \u201cThere is no evidence Biden traveled that much with Xi, the president of China \u2014 and even if we added up the miles Biden flew to see Xi, it still did not total 17,000 miles,\u201d Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote Monday. Biden made the comment for the 20th and 21st times during political events in California and New Mexico last week. The newspaper created the \u201cbottomless\u201d rating during the Trump administration to describe \u201cfalse or misleading statements repeated so often that they became a form of propaganda.\u201d Trump earned 56 such ratings by the time he left office in January 2021. Kessler also called out the president for claiming that \u201cthe most common price of gas in America is $3.39 \u2014 down from over $5 when I took office,\u201d which he said Oct. 27. Biden repeated the claim on Twitter Sunday, noting that the \u201cmost common price at gas stations across the country is $3.19.\u201d The issue is with Biden\u2019s use of the term \u201cmost common\u201d \u2014 which does not equal the \u201caverage.\u201d The average price at the pump when he took office was about $2.48, according to the Energy Information Administration. While it\u2019s true that the most common price for gas \u2014 or the mathematical \u201cmode\u201d of all prices \u2014 was about $3.19, according to the GasBuddy App, the average price of gas was about $3.80 per gallon as of Monday, according to AAA. By referring to the most-often-seen price, Biden sidestepped having to incorporate some of the highest prices seen in the US in his tally. The Washington Post also criticized the White House for touting both in public remarks and a since-deleted Nov. 1 tweet that seniors were \u201cgetting the biggest increase in their Social Security in 10 years through President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u201d While the remark is technically true, it\u2019s not because of some tremendous feat by the administration. The reason for the hike is soaring inflation: A 1972 law holds that Social Security must be adjusted each year to keep up with inflation rates.

The \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d screenwriter continued, \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to leave. I could tell something was up.\u201d According to Coogler, Boseman insisted he didn\u2019t want to read the sequel\u2019s script so as not to intrude on any of Marvel\u2019s decisions regarding the film. \u201cI found out later he was too tired to read anything,\u201d Coogler said.

The Colts' 26-3 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday was their third straight defeat. It was the latest example of their deepening offensive challenges that are beginning to appear insurmountable despite a recent quarterback change from Matt Ryan to Sam Ehlinger and last week's firing of offensive coordinator Marcus Brady. Reich, 60, was 40-33-1 (.547) in the regular season and had a 1-2 record in two playoff appearances. It was a tenure defined by incessant turnover at quarterback; the Colts had different opening-day starters in each of Reich's five seasons, as the franchise has struggled to find a quarterback to fill the shoes of Andrew Luck, who retired before the 2019 season. The tenures of the past two -- Carson Wentz and Ryan -- ended in ugly fashion (Wentz was traded after one season and Ryan benched after seven starts). The Colts have been unraveling since the end of last season, when Indianapolis lost its final two games despite needing just one victory to clinch a postseason berth. The 2021 finale, a 26-11 loss to the 3-14 Jacksonville Jaguars, was a particularly unsightly performance that drew owner Jim Irsay's ire and prompted him to recommit to fixing the problems that led to the poor finish. Ultimately, 2022 has not brought markedly different results. Offensively, the Colts (3-5-1) are in the worst shape of Reich's tenure. After Sunday's game, the longtime NFL quarterback and Super Bowl-winning offensive coordinator with the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles alluded to the frustration of the Colts being so inept on offense, his area of expertise. \"Offensive performance, that's why I was brought here. That's my responsibility,\" he said. \"So, we've got the players. We've got the players that are plenty good enough. I have to do a better job. It starts with me on offense. I need to do a better job getting the guys ready to play, putting guys in a good position to win and having answers when we face problems.\" Lately, there have been no answers. The Colts failed to convert any of their 14 third-down attempts Sunday, tied for the worst single-game mark in the NFL in the past 30 years. Indianapolis generated 121 yards of total offense, the team's lowest output since 1997 and the lowest of Reich's tenure by 84 yards. Reich gained a reputation during his time in Indianapolis for being able to bring the team back from the brink. The Colts have been notoriously slow starters, but they have consistently rallied late in seasons. The Colts started 1-5 in 2018 but finished 10-6 and made the playoffs. Last year, they started 1-4 before rallying to 9-6, only to lose those final two regular-season games.

Market researcher TrendForce last week cut its iPhone shipment forecast for October-December by 2 million to 3 million units, from 80 million, due to the factory\u2019s troubles, adding its investigation found capacity utilization rates around 70%. Apple, which began selling its iPhone 14 range in September, said customers should expect longer waiting times. \u201cAnything that affects Apple\u2019s production obviously affects their share price,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. \u201cBut this is part of a much deeper story \u2013 the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Chinese economy\u2026 These headlines are part of the ongoing saga as to whether there is any truth to the consistent rumors that authorities are discussing whether some of the measures will be lifted in the first quarter.\u201d China on Monday reported its highest number of new COVID-19 infections in six months, with disruption to the world\u2019s second-largest economy spreading nationwide since October. At the weekend, health officials said they would stick with strict coronavirus curbs, disappointing investors hoping for easing. Meanwhile, Apple expects to produce at least 3 million fewer iPhone 14 handsets this year than planned due to weak demand for lower-end models, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the plan. The world\u2019s most valuable firm, with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, last month forecast October-December revenue growth would slow from the previous quarter\u2019s 8% \u2013 though market watchers regarded that favorably in a battered sector. \u201cGiven that Apple reported only two weeks ago with positive guidance, we think this points to the potential for a longer and more severe lockdown,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts said, expecting iPhone sales to be pushed to later quarters than lost. They estimated Apple\u2019s revenue to rise 3% in the current quarter, with iPhone sales growing 2% to $73 billion. Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn is the world\u2019s largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone maker, accounting for 70% of shipments globally. It has iPhone production sites in India and southern China, but its biggest is in the city of Zhengzhou in the eastern Chinese province of Henan. Local officials recently commented on cases of COVID-19 at the plant. Foxconn has declined to disclose the number of infections or comment on the conditions of those infected. On Monday, it said it was working to resume full production at Zhengzhou as soon as possible. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Foxconn\u2019s target is by the second half of November. At the request of the local government, Foxconn said it would implement measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including restricting employee movement to between their dormitory and factory area.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "technology", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [14.518527030944824, -3.0252315998077393]}, {"title": "\u2018Heard a big bang\u2019: California man believes meteor may have destroyed his home", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/california-man-believes-meteor-may-have-destroyed-his-home/", "description": "A Northern California man says a meteor dropped from the sky and set his house ablaze Friday night after several witnesses reported seeing a bright ball of light set off across the sky.", "content": "Now that\u2019s a real kick in the asteroid.

While scrambling away from rapidly growing flames, Procita was only able to save one of his two dogs. The second dog, named Tug, died in the fire, according to a GoFundMe . After the puzzling incident, Procita was shown videos taken by others in the region who had spotted the bright ball of light moving across the dark night sky. \u201cDefinitely feel very lucky that it was 30 feet away from me and not five,\u201d he said, adding that what he had seen in the videos looked \u201clike a flaming basketball.\u201d According to NASA, the southern Taurids meteor shower peaks this week.

Since it was in a secluded location, firefighters with the Smartsville Fire Department and CalFire aided in the firefight. Even though Halloween has passed, Procita said the fireball hitting his home may be a sign of luck. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a 1 in 4 trillion chance, so I guess I might be buying a lottery ticket today,\u201d he joked.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [4.6477155685424805, 19.942873001098633]}, {"title": "Elon Musk recommends votes for \u2018Republican Congress\u2019 in midterms", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-recommends-votes-for-republican-congress-in-midterms/", "description": "Billionaire Elon Musk urged undecided voters to back Republican candidates ahead of critical midterm elections on Tuesday that will determine control of Congress.", "content": "Billionaire Elon Musk urged undecided voters to back Republican candidates ahead of critical midterm elections on Tuesday that will determine control of Congress. \u201cTo independent-minded voters: Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who\u2019s in charge!\u201d Musk added.

He was 70. The Avalanche, in a joint statement with Altitude TV, announced his death on social media. McNab released in late summer of 2021 that he was battling cancer, but in February he said that it was in remission. McNab was part of the broadcast team when the Avalanche captured their third Stanley Cup last June over Tampa Bay. The charismatic McNab saw and experienced just about every step of the journey since the Avalanche arrived in Denver from Quebec before the 1995-96 season. He had a front-row seat for the exploits of Joe Sakic, Patrick Roy and Peter Forsberg, for the legendary \u2014 and contentious \u2014 clashes with the Detroit Red Wings and for the dawn of a new era that featured Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar. \u201cAs good as a hockey man as he was, he will be most remembered for being a friend to so many,\u201d Sakic, the Hall of Fame forward turned team executive, said in a statement. \u201cOn behalf of the Avalanche organization, we send our deepest condolences to the entire McNab family. Peter will be greatly missed.\u201d After a successful career at the University of Denver, McNab played in parts of 14 NHL seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, Boston Bruins, Vancouver Canucks and New Jersey Devils. He finished with 363 goals and 450 assists in 995 career regular-season games. McNab helped the Sabres to the 1975 Stanley Cup final, where they were beaten in six games by Philadelphia. Once his playing career was finished, McNab ventured into the realm of broadcasting, where he was an analyst with the Devils before joining the Avalanche. In addition, McNab served as a hockey analyst at several Winter Olympics. Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, McNab grew up in San Diego. He played three seasons for the Pioneers 1970-1973, where he helped Denver to a runner-up finish in the NCAA Division I championship game in \u201973. He was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 2021. \u201cThe hockey world lost a good one here,\u201d former Avalanche and current Nashville forward Matt Duchene posted on social media. \u201cPete absolutely loved the game and couldn\u2019t have been a nicer man and it was a pleasure to know him.\u201d Added owner E. Stanley Kroenke and president Josh Kroenke in a joint statement: \u201cPeter\u2019s passion for hockey was singular \u2014 as was his gift for celebrating what makes the sport so special. We were blessed that, for 27 years, he was an integral and indispensable part of our organization.

Almost one in five Americans also believe people should watch the New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop in Times Square in person at least once in their lives before turning 40. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of VSP Vision Care , the data found that 83% of respondents have been planning for their futures, and 73% are optimistic about what\u2019s to come in their lives. But how have people been planning for the future? Most respondents said by exercising more or going to the doctor (54%), saving money (52%) and setting realistic goals (42%). And with all of these goals in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that four in five believe it\u2019s important to have clear vision and healthy eyes to experience these moments in life (79%). \u201cEye health can affect so many aspects of our lives from work to school and all of those special moments in between, because so much of how we interact with the world is visual,\u201d said Dr. Valerie Sheety-Pilon, vice president of clinical and medical affairs at VSP Vision. \u201cReceiving an annual eye exam is a simple yet powerful way to make sure you enjoy all of life\u2019s great moments.\u201d The survey further delved into people\u2019s futures, revealing what younger and older generations see for themselves. Gen Zers (18 to 25) see themselves receiving a promotion/raise and starting a family a decade from now (both 19%). Meanwhile, millennials (26 to 41) picture themselves owning a business (28%) and a home (23%), as well as growing their families (19%) and securing a better job (16%). On the other hand, Gen X (42 to 57) wants to focus more on becoming healthier (21%) and traveling with a person they love (19%). The results suggest that boomers (58 to 76) plan to put their health first in their later years (45%) and also look forward to traveling with a loved one in 10 years (19%). While three in four are thankful they have good health (74%), more respondents think one is never too young or old to get screened for health conditions (79%). When asked if they knew eye exams could detect other health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, seven in 10 responded they were aware (72%), but 28% didn\u2019t know that was the case. And if they knew that information sooner, 27% said they would go to an optometrist more often. \u201cOptometrists have a unique vantage point into the health of your bodies through your eyes,\u201d continued Dr. Sheety-Pilon. \u201cIn fact, eye exams not only help ensure clear vision, but they can also provide early detection of up to 270 health conditions, making now the perfect time to enroll in a vision benefit plan and prioritize both your eye and overall health.\u201d TOP 20 THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD EXPERIENCE BEFORE TURNING 40 Survey methodology: This random double-opt-in survey of 2,000 general population Americans, evenly split by generation was commissioned by VSP Vision Care between Sept. 30 and Oct. 4, 2022.

Most of these shows juggle the same handful of problems: How do you handle an in-office crush? What do you do with a boss you hate? How do you balance new ideas with tried-and-true methods? Those are never the questions Mythic Quest on Apple TV+ cares about. For its third season in a row, Rob McElhenney and Megan Ganz \u2018s comedy once again skirts the predictable to explore the niche corners of corporate America. It\u2019s true that most of the hurdles addressed this season have to do with middle and upper management. For example, Carol (Naomi Ekperigin), this show\u2019s underrated HR head, finds herself as the Head of Diversity after failing her way up. But once she\u2019s there, her work ethic constantly battles against the relief that comes with obtaining a cushy job. To a lesser degree, Rachel (Ashly Burch) finds herself in a similar predicament. Meanwhile, Poppy (Charlotte Nicdao) and Ian\u2019s (McElhenney) journeys both have to do with their egos. After spending oh-so-many years of hyping themselves up to believe they can do anything, both of them are slapped with the realization that isn\u2019t true. They have limits, no matter what their deepest insecurities tricked them into believing. It\u2019s through that specificity that Mythic Quest shines. Every comedy on the market jokes about how work sucks. But few have explored the exhausting push and pull that comes when you turn your creative passions into your livelihood. Even fewer have tried to grapple with the exhilarating and toxic emotions that emerge when that commercialized passion becomes how you measure your self-worth. These are big, a-year-into-therapy ideas. Yet Mythic Quest is able to throw them out as casually and confidently as any one of Brad\u2019s (Danny Pudi) insults. It\u2019s a work of art. Mythic Quest doesn\u2019t want to be everything for every office worker. It wants to honestly reflect the specific frustrations of a select few. It\u2019s through that hyper-focus \u2014 these longer emotional journeys that force viewers to keep track of who\u2019s where on the corporate ladder, how they got there, and what it cost \u2014 that Mythic Quest becomes universally relatable. Everyone\u2019s workplace struggles are endlessly fascinating to them and boring to everyone else. McElhenney and Ganz\u2019s comedy continues to erase that line, transforming the snarky emails and dull office parties that would typically make your eyes glaze over into genuine sources of drama. There are parts to Season 3 that are a tad too cutesy. Ian and Poppy\u2019s new edgeless and windowless office, for example, always feels too cartoonish for the rest of this show. Likewise, this season\u2019s standalone episode isn\u2019t as strong as others. It\u2019s sweet, and it does fit into the themes of this season. But it\u2019s also an episode where the edges are slightly too perfect, an element that feels jarring for this show that delights in the messy. But when it comes to the broad brushstrokes, Mythic Quest still reigns supreme. There is simply no other show that better understands both the privileged and endlessly stressful position of being paid to do what you love. That was true in 2020, and it remains true two years and an entirely new working ecosystem later.

The songstress, who catapulted to the top of the charts with hit albums such as \u201cPure Heroine,\u201d \u201cMelodrama,\u201d and \u201cSolar Power\u201d and major songs like \u201cRoyals,\u201d \u201cTennis Court,\u201d \u201cTeam\u201d and \u201cGreen Light,\u201d has shown that she is a true force to be reckoned with. With a host of awards, including two Grammy awards, two Brit awards and a Golden Globe nomination, Lorde, 26, has also sold over five million albums worldwide. But dominating the airwaves isn\u2019t her only gift, as she\u2019s a mainstay on the red carpet, heating up concerts and awards shows and on the cover of global magazines . So what makes her so brilliant? Is it that she\u2019s channeling the muse or just in the right place at the right time? Join me as we dive into her stars because I\u2019m a pop culture astrologer and I can see it all. Lorde was born on November 7, 1996. This makes her a Scorpio Sun with a Virgo Moon and Capricorn Ascendant. When looking at her elemental energy , we can see that she is heavily composed of Earth and Water. This is what brings her the deep, introspective and moody vibe that radiates through her body of work. Her emotional sensitivity is profound, but she also knows how to ground herself and be practical without spinning off into her feelings and never being rooted in reality. Because of this, she is able to channel her emotions and work ethic harmoniously. When analyzing key themes that run through her birth chart , there are a few that pop up. First off \u2014 not that this should be surprising \u2014 but she is immensely lucky. In fact, luck is a lifestyle for her. The reason I say this is because Jupiter, the planet of miracles and expansion, is exactly united with her Ascendant \u2014 or better known as her body and identity. This quite literally means she was born under the luckiest star. She\u2019s larger than life, expansive, optimistic, generous and philosophical, attracting good fortune to her through all of these means. She\u2019s \u201cgo big or go home\u201d in every way, but because of this innate courage and belief in the good in herself \u2014 and the world \u2014 people naturally respect her. This is a sign of a natural-born leader, as is the fact that her Saturn, the planet of strength, flows perfectly with Pluto, the planet of power. She has always had a deep focus on authority and the natural charisma and magnetism to command. Achievement is important to her. Then, her Sun, tied to her life force, dances perfectly with her Ascendant and Jupiter, as well. She attracts good fortune forever \u2014 it flows through her in and out. She radiates like a light and wishes to share that brilliance and fortune with others. This is all so potently woven through her cosmic makeup. Last to mention around this theme of lucky ambition is that her Moon, tied to her soul and inner emotional world, is also exactly united with her Midheaven \u2014 or highest point of success and public recognition. Her sensitivity \u2014 and dramatic side \u2014 instantly allow her to influence others on a global scale and give her this enigmatic, mysterious quality. I\u2019d even go as far as to call it hypnotic. The last theme I want to highlight is that Lorde truly is a savant of communication and artistry. Her Sun is exactly united with Mercury, the planet of the mind, persuasion and speech. She\u2019s quick-witted and independent in her thoughts and vision and thrives on inspiration. She has a wide perspective on life and can\u2019t be limited in a cage or a box \u2014 she quite literally must speak and broadcast her ideas. Then, with her Moon dancing ever so elegantly with Neptune, the planet of imagination, she possesses a majestic and poetic touch that she can weave with depth, meaning and clarity as she sees fit. So what lies ahead on the path for our dear Lorde? Let\u2019s take a peek! First, I want to mention that she\u2019s going through a tremendously intense whirlwind in her life \u2014 and relationships \u2014 due to the eclipse cycle in Taurus and Scorpio that began at the end of 2021 and echoes on until the end of 2023. This means she\u2019s emerging like a phoenix and craving more freedom and power as she leaves behind one era of her life and considers what she wants in her next one. Her relationships \u2014 in business and love \u2014 are also evolving before her very eyes and will see developments positively if they\u2019re in alignment or negatively if they are just stifling her. Luckily, these powerful eclipses are also bringing exhilarating inspiration and opportunities for her to reach newfound aspirations during this entire time, too. I love this for her. Last to mention is that Jupiter, the planet of miracles, will spin in her sector of true love, creativity and fertility beginning May 2023 for over a year \u2014 bringing joy and expansion around all of these themes. New music? Guaranteed! However, her Saturn return begins toward 2025, so this will be yet another period where she re-evaluates her path and decides where she will place her roots for the coming decades ahead.

An SEC West title remains within reach if Ole Miss wins out and LSU loses once more. That will be motivation enough on Saturday as Alabama comes to Oxford. Everyone\u2019s preseason favorite was all but eliminated from the playoff by LSU on Saturday night, a stunning turn for a team that was supposed to moonwalk to the final four. New: LSU (7-2) Dropped out: Clemson (8-1) The junior ran for 109 yards in the win at Rutgers, and it was his lowest total since Sept. 17. He\u2019s been that consistent for two months. Hooker threw for a season-low 195 yards and no touchdowns in the loss at Georgia, a dismal performance that may cost him the Heisman. Heavy winds certainly contributed to his career-worst 76-yard passing effort in the win over Northwestern. He can pile up big numbers the next two weeks against Indiana and Maryland, but Stroud\u2019s shot at winning the Heisman will be tied to how he performs in The Game on Thanksgiving weekend against Michigan. That\u2019s now four games of at least 300 yards passing and four touchdowns for Williams, who at least deserves an invite to New York City as one of the Heisman finalists. In Alabama\u2019s two losses, Young has thrown for 785 yards, three touchdowns and one interception.

A post shared by Camille Kostek (@camillekostek) \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool sisterhood,\u201d Kostek said. \u201cYou hang out, you have slumber parties while the guys are at away games, you have a lot of girl talk, you understand a lot of the challenges we face dating guys in a space that is super dangerous at times, the concerns we have and having to be away from them while they\u2019re on the road a lot or at practices and training camp, and different things that we all just kind of share.\u201d Kostek began dating Gronkowski when he was playing tight end for the Patriots. The actress was a Patriots cheerleader when Gronkowski won his first Super Bowl with the team in February 2015. Kostek added that she still watches NFL games despite Gronkowski being retired. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t know if you could hear it in the background. I\u2019m actually watching the Bucs game right now,\u201d she said while pointing to the Buccaneers-Rams game on her television Sunday. Gronkowski retired in 2019 after nine years with the Patriots, but returned to the NFL to reunite with Tom Brady for another run at the Super Bowl in 2020. He retired again in June . When asked why she decided to end her career as an NFL cheerleader, Kostek said she had other things she wanted to pursue. \u201cI felt like I truly lived out the best experience that I could on the team. I cheered for two seasons with the New England Patriots, and I went on a tour to China with three other teammates, I cheered at a winning Super Bowl for Super Bowl XLIX,\u201d Kostek said. \u201cI knew I wanted to move away from the East Coast and fulfill dreams on the West Coast so that\u2019s what I did. That\u2019s why I resigned.\u201d Kostek joined the Patriots\u2019 cheerleading roster in 2013 and landed the cover of the cheerleaders\u2019 annual swimsuit calendar, which was shot in Saint Lucia.

This is for my mom and my dad, my mom that passed in January, and my brother and all my boys,\u201d he said afterwards, breaking off to hug his wife and high-five those rushing to congratulate him. \u201cGod, dang it,\u201d Baker continued, turning back to the ESPN reporter with a wide grin. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d The 73-year-old had achieved everything else \u2013 the only manager in MLB history to lead five different teams to the postseason and to win division titles with five different clubs, the first Black manager to win 2,000 career games and one of only two individuals in MLB history to produce 1,800 hits as a player and 1,800 wins as a manager. \u201cI mean, I got 2,000 wins and all they talk about is I haven\u2019t won the World Series yet, you know?\u201d he said before the game, according to MLB.com. \u201cSo, yeah, it matters. It matters to the people. It matters to us.\u201d With this victory, Baker became the third Black manager to win the World Series after Dave Roberts and Cito Gaston. \u201cMy mom, she told me a number of times, to be African-American, you\u2019ve got to be twice as good to achieve the same thing,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cI heard that over and over.\u201d Baker had come agonizingly close to achieving that elusive World Series title before, reaching the final hurdle twice \u2013 in 2002 with the San Francisco Giants, when they were 5-0 up and eight outs away from the title at one point in Game 6, and in 2021 with the Astros. For almost 30 years since he took charge of his first team \u2013 the Giants \u2013 in 1993, Baker had pursued this goal that fluttered out of his reach whenever it came within touching distance. He was the crowd\u2019s favorite, beloved across baseball for his empathy and thoughtfulness, the one who everyone rooted for but always seemed to finish second. Astros outfielder and first baseman Trey Mancini detailed Baker\u2019s kindness towards his players in an interview with The Athletic. Some players on the team like banana pudding, Mancini said, and so Baker would buy it for them on the road and leave it in their lockers, while he visited St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and brought back a rosary for Mancini. For an Astros team still reeling from the fallout that marred its 2017 World Series title when MLB found that the franchise illegally created a system that decoded and communicated the opposing teams\u2019 pitching signs, Baker proved to be the perfect antidote. \u201cWhen he came here in 2020, we had the whole cheating scandal and we had Covid,\u201d starter Lance McCullers Jr. said, according to the New York Times. \u201cHe was a stabilizing force for us. I wish we could have done it a little bit sooner for him, but he truly deserved this.\u201d And with this World Series title, Baker becomes not only the oldest manager in the MLB to win its biggest prize, but older than every other head coach who has won a Super Bowl, NBA championship or a Stanley Cup. \u201cI just knew it was going to happen, sooner or later, you stick around long enough and you\u2019ve got good teams. I said, if I win one, I want to win two, so we might as well go for two \u2013 we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said afterwards. Before coaching, Baker enjoyed a successful playing career, winning the World Series in 1981 with the Los Angeles Dodgers and his 40 years in between titles is the most between any two consecutive World Series won as a player or manager, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that it took this long,\u201d Baker added. \u201cBecause had this happened years ago, maybe I wouldn\u2019t even be here. \u201cMaybe, it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, so that I could hopefully influence a few young mens\u2019 lives and families, and a number of people in the country, showing what perseverance and character can do for you.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "cnn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-13.572721481323242, -19.554258346557617]}, {"title": "Lee Zeldin aggressively targeting NYC voters to defeat Kathy Hochul in tight gov race", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/lee-zeldin-aggressively-targeting-nyc-voters-to-defeat-kathy-hochul-in-tight-gov-race/", "description": "A Republican needs to break a minimum of 30% of the vote in the Big Apple to have a shot at winning statewide, Zeldin said, noting that some polls have him pulling 35% or more, while making significant inroads among Latino voters.", "content": "With recent polls showing him with momentum in the tight race for governor, Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin is aggressively targeting New York City voters fed up with crime in his bid to pull off a stunning upset over incumbent Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday. The Long Island congressman said his early bird April 2021 entry into the race has paid off \u2014 giving him an opportunity for the last 18 months to stump across the five boroughs spreading his crime-fighting message, and make inroads on his strategic map with Democrats as well as Republicans and independents. \u201cWe\u2019ve been all over the city,\u201d Zeldin, 42, told The Post between campaign stops on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had extensive engagement with the Asian, Latino and orthodox Jewish communities.\u201d A Republican needs to break a minimum of 30% of the vote in the Big Apple to have a shot at winning statewide, Zeldin said, noting that some polls have him pulling 35% or more, while making significant inroads among Latino voters. \u201cIf we get 35% or more of the vote in New York City we win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to get our voters to the polls by 9 p.m. Tuesday. If we do, I can\u2019t wait to get to work on Wednesday.\u201d GOP operatives predict Zeldin could give Hochul a run for her money in areas with big Orthodox Jewish and Asian-American populations \u2014- such as southern Brooklyn, large swaths of central and northeast Queens and the northern parts of the Bronx \u2014 as well as Inwood and Washington Heights in northern Manhattan, home to large Latino and Hispanic communities. Zeldin is also expected to carry more conservative Staten Island over Hochul by a double-digit margin. \u201cI think 62 to 65% of the vote for Zeldin on Staten Island is a realistic target, with the turnout rate being higher than most of the other boroughs,\u201d said borough Councilman Joe Borelli, a Republican. Zeldin will romp in Staten Island\u2019s more conservative south shore, from Great Kills to Tottenville, as well as carry the east shore and mid-island neighborhoods of Rosebank, Midland Beach, South Beach, Grant City Dongan Hills, Todt Hill, New Springville, Willowbrook and Travis, GOP sources said. The island\u2019s population of 500,000 includes lots of police officers and other uniformed officers as well as Wall Street employees or other Manhattan commuters disgusted over crime. Support for cops and law and order \u2014 and opposition to New York state\u2019s cashless bail law \u2014 among voters there makes Richmond County fertile ground for Zeldin. \u201cThe crime message has taken hold. People want to feel safe on the subway and in the streets,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cPeople are not happy with the cashless bail law and other pro-criminal laws supported by Kathy Hochul and Democrats in Albany.\u201d While crime has drawn most of the attention, Zeldin said Sunday that education has emerged as an important issue in the city: Asian-American parents are ticked off at attempts to end merit-based elite high schools, while the Orthodox Jewish community is upset at a state crackdown on Yeshivas and some families, many of them minorities, are clamoring for more charter schools that Hochul and the Democratic-run state Legislature won\u2019t allow to expand. Zeldin said he supports merit-based middle schools and high schools, lifting the state cap on charter schools in New York City and defending religious-based education from Albany interference over what is taught. He also predicted he will \u201cperform much better with Latino voters\u201d than the political class expects. The now-infamous case of bodega clerk Jose Alba , who was charged with murder for fatally stabbing an assailant in self-defense, was a turning point with many Latino voters in the city, Zeldin said. The charges were later dropped by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office following an outcry \u2014 but the damage was done. \u201cAlvin Bragg charged Jose Alba with murder for defending himself! The Dominican community has engaged our campaign with passion and purpose,\u201d said Zeldin, who was recently endorsed by a group of Latino grocery market owners and said he would oust Bragg as DA. Zeldin could match or even do better in other city neighborhoods that went red in the mayor\u2019s race last year \u2014 backing Republican Curtis Sliwa over Democrat Mayor Eric Adams. The stunning 30 percentage point victory of GOP Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in the one-time Democratic-leaning district in southern Brooklyn shows it is prime turf where Zeldin could best Hochul, sources said. Many of the predominantly Jewish voters in neighborhoods including Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach, Bergen Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Gerritsen Beach and Mill Basin fled Russia, Ukraine and other Soviet-sphere countries a generation ago and detest communism and socialism, though a large chunk are registered Democrats. The Ukrainian-born Vernikov \u2014 whose chief of staff Izzy Weiss is helping the Zeldin campaign with get-out-the-vote efforts \u2014 said she foresees the gubernatorial hopeful to get a big slice of the votes in her district. \u201cI expect Congressman Zeldin to get at least 75% of the vote here, as everyone is united and excited to elect him,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is Zeldin turf and we can\u2019t wait to welcome Lee as our next governor!\u201d Zeldin also is counting on a big vote from conservative ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters in Williamsburg, Borough Park and Midwood and Asian voters in Bensonhurst, as well backing from pro-cop residents in Dyker Heights. The Zeldin camp is expected to win districts in more than a dozen Queens neighborhood cutting across the borough to the Nassau County border, including Maspeth, Glendale, Woodhaven, Middle Village, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, Breezy Point, Rego Park, Kew Gardens Hills, Northern Flushing, Whitestone, College Point, Douglaston, and Little Neck. \u201cI believe Zeldin is going to perform well throughout District 32, especially in areas that have not, historically, voted Republican such as Woodhaven and Ozone Park,\u201d said GOP Councilwoman Joann Ariola , who represents eastern Queens along the Rockaway peninsula. \u201cThe uptick in crime on our streets and subways as well as gun violence that has been plaguing our city have now become more prevalent in these otherwise quiet low crime areas causing voters to seek change,\u201d she said. Councilman Robert Holden , a Democrat who supports Zeldin, said the Republican will carry his 30th district that includes Glendale, Maspeth, Middle Village, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, and Woodside \u201cby a good margin.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had crime here that we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Holden, who noted that Zeldin has visited communities in his district four times, including after a gas station was robbed. Last year, Republican Councilwoman Vicki Paladino won a long-held Democrat seat in an upset in District 19 in Northeast Queens, which includes Whitestone, College Point, Bayside, Little Neck, Douglaston, and parts of North Flushing. More than a third of the voters in district are Asian-Americans. Paladino\u2019s chief of staff, Nicole Kiprilov, said Zeldin is getting a \u201cgreat reception\u201d in northeast Queens, including from Latino voters, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s momentum from last year\u2019s election. The winning platform is common sense.\u201d Meanwhile in the Bronx, county GOP chairman Anthony Rendino said Zeldin will make some inroads in the heavily Latino borough because voters are \u201cunhappy with the Democrats\u201d, particularly over surging crime. \u201cWe\u2019re making huge inroads in the Latino community,\u201d said Rendino, who expects Zeldin to do well in City Island, Soundview, Hunts Point, Throgs Neck, Morris Park, Parkchester, Riverdale and Woodlawn. Zeldin said he has gotten \u201cmassive turnouts\u201d at his events, while Hochul on Friday generated a puny turnout at one in Chinatown .

But he\u2019ll have to face his prime-time woes to keep it going forward. Dalton was named the starter over a healthy Winston last week and responded with an efficient win against the Las Vegas Raiders, finishing with two touchdowns and a 117.2 quarterback rating in the 24-0 win. According to Saints coach Dennis Allen, the job is Dalton\u2019s as long as the offense keeps clicking. \u201cAndy's starting, and if we continue to play like we have on offense -- which is what our expectation is -- like I said last week, Andy will be the starter moving forward, and I don't think we should get into any hypotheticals or things like that,\" Allen said. \"It's his show to run right now, and we'll see how that goes.\" That means that Dalton can\u2019t take a step backward with the Baltimore Ravens (5-3) coming to town for \"Monday Night Football\" (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Caesars Superdome. While the Saints (3-5) have lost their past three prime-time games at home, for a long time it was a place they thrived. They went 6-1 in those games between 2017 and 2020, and Allen believes in that success again. \u201cI think the atmosphere in the dome in a night game is probably as good as I\u2019ve ever been around, and I don\u2019t expect anything to be different this Monday night,\u201d Allen said. Saints rookie wide receiver Chris Olave is excited to get his first taste of the action. \u201cI heard it\u2019s going to be crazy,\" Olave said. \"Primetime in the dome? The regular games be loud, so I can\u2019t wait to finally have a prime-time game in New Orleans.\u201d Dalton has yet to find that same success when the lights are brightest. He is looking for his first prime-time win since Sept. 13, 2018, a four-touchdown performance during \"Sunday Night Football\" against the very same Ravens when Dalton was the starter for the Cincinnati Bengals. His last Monday night win as a starter was against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 22, 2014. Dalton has had some rough outings in the spotlight, with one of his worst coming in a 24-3 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 6, 2014. Dalton threw three interceptions, no touchdowns and finished the game with a passer rating of 2.0. Dalton said that never got into his head -- then or now. \"Obviously, early on [with the Bengals], we had some prime-time games against some really good teams and weren\u2019t able to come with victories in those games,\" Dalton said, \"but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d Dalton, who was signed in the offseason, got the job when Winston was sidelined with a back injury after Week 3. Winston got hurt in New Orleans' win over the Atlanta Falcons in Week 1 and played through the injury for two games before the Saints sat him to recover. Dalton has gone 2-3 as the starter and is averaging 235 passing yards per game. He has thrown nine touchdowns and four interceptions this season, in comparison to Winston's four touchdowns and five interceptions. While last week's win -- where Dalton didn't turn the ball over -- certainly helped back up Allen\u2019s decision to name Dalton as the starter, getting a win in primetime would be the next step for Dalton. While Dalton threw four touchdowns in the Week 7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, he also threw three first-half interceptions -- two of which were returned for touchdowns. But his production was enough to earn him the starting nod. \"I think that was just a decision that we made, and we played well last week,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI think we had a ton of confidence in Andy and what the offense has been able to do since he's been in there. I think that confidence has been there.\" The Saints have had their issues on offense, but they\u2019ve also started to click in the past few weeks, quietly creeping up the rankings, where they currently sit at No. 4 in total offense (394.4 yards per game) and No. 8 in scoring offense (24.9 points per game). They also are No. 8 in rushing yards (141.3 per game) and passing yards (253.1) despite losing wide receivers Jarvis Landry and Michael Thomas for the past month, with Thomas going on what is likely season-ending injured reserve Thursday. \u201cI think the bright spot has been some guys have kind of stepped up and made some plays for us,\u201d Allen said. \u201cObviously, Rashid Shaheed has stepped up and made some plays, [Marquez] Callaway made a nice catch on the slant route to convert a first down the other day, Kevin White caught a [64-yard] shallow cross against Arizona. So I think all those guys have kind of stepped up and made some plays when their number has been called.\u201d Dalton will certainly have to overcome some historically bad statistics as he prepares to face the Ravens. If the Saints lose to Baltimore, Dalton\u2019s prime-time record will fall to 6-20 (.231), falling behind Kerry Collins for the worst of any quarterback with at least 15 prime-time starts since 2000. Dalton lost five straight of those games by at least 17 points between 2018 and 2021, a streak that was broken with the 42-34 loss to the Cardinals on Oct. 20. Allen said none of that matters though. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly been no discussion of anything like that in our building,\u201d Allen said. \"This is another game for us -- whether we\u2019re playing at 9:30 in the morning or 7:15 at night -- I don\u2019t think it really matters. I\u2019m confident that Andy can go there and play well.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-31.660032272338867, -8.424233436584473]}, {"title": "FAQ: What's at stake at the COP27 global climate negotiations", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/07/1132796190/faq-whats-at-stake-at-the-cop27-global-climate-negotiations", "description": "World leaders are meeting in Egypt for the next two weeks to talk about reining in climate change and paying for its deadly effects.

Hundreds of world leaders will spend the next two weeks discussing global efforts to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pay for the costs of climate change. The meeting comes at a crucial time for the planet: if nations, including the United States, follow through on their current promises to pivot away from fossil fuels, it's still possible to avoid catastrophic warming later this century.

Under that agreement, basically every country in the world promised to address climate change by coming up with their own plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions that are making the world hotter. Since then, the annual meeting has taken on extra significance, because it's the official time to check in on those promises, and make new ones. For example, the U.S. promised to cut its emissions by about half by 2030. In United Nations jargon, the meeting is called the Conference of the Parties, or COP. This is the 27th Conference of the Parties meeting, so it's frequently referred to as COP27. At last year's meeting , world leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions more quickly than in the past. But they failed to make substantive promises about how that would happen. Since then, there have been some big geopolitical changes. The Russian invasion of Ukraine will loom over this year's meeting. The invasion further complicated relationships between the world's largest economies, and upended global fossil fuel markets. One immediate effect of the war is multiple countries including China have increased their short-term reliance on coal-fired power plants, which are the most intense global source of greenhouse gas emissions. Another effect is that many countries, especially in Europe, are scrambling to develop new sources of natural gas to replace imports of Russian gas. In order to avoid the direst climate catastrophes in the future, nearly all new gas, coal and oil have to stay in the ground, experts say. But there have been positive developments as well. Renewable energy, such as wind and solar, is growing rapidly. The International Energy Agency predicts that global demand for all types of fossil fuels will peak by the mid-2030s. Loading... In short, the world is way off track from its goal of cutting the pollution that drives climate change. Collectively, nations have promised to cut their emissions by about 3% by 2030. But the science shows emissions need to fall dramatically faster \u2013 45% by 2030. That's to limit warming to the goal set by the Paris climate agreement: 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. That's about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Most nations aren't even cutting emissions enough to meet the pledges they've already made. So today, the world is heading toward about 5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by 2100. While a handful of countries are expected to make new, more ambitious emissions pledges at these talks, the countries producing most of the climate pollution aren't expected to make dramatic cutbacks. Two of the largest emitters, China and India, plan to increase emissions until 2030. They've argued that their growing economies need the support of fossil fuels, as other wealthier countries have historically done. The science is clear: the faster greenhouse emissions drop, the more lives and livelihoods will be saved. And the sooner, the better. We know that because earlier this year, international climate scientists finished publishing the most comprehensive climate science report ever. It catalogued the ways in which climate change is affecting everyday lives around the world, because the Earth is already about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) hotter than it was in the late 1800s. Scientists say it's possible to limit overall global warming to about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, (2 degrees Celsius), which is the upper limit set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Loading... Scientists also warn that decades of sea level rise, extreme drought, heat waves and storms are unavoidable because of how much global temperatures have already risen. That means billions of people will need to adapt to a hotter Earth. But limiting emissions could avoid some of the most extreme impacts, like much more deadly heat waves, more flooding in coastal cities due to sea level rise and the loss of almost all coral reefs. Developing countries are getting increasingly frustrated with wealthier nations. Most low-income countries have done little to cause climate change, since their greenhouse gas emissions are small. But impacts like extreme storms and flooding are taking a huge toll on them, often because they lack the resources to better protect themselves. This year, a coalition of the most vulnerable countries is seeking compensation for these costs, known as \"loss and damage.\" They argue that wealthier nations should pay for the problems they caused, including the cultural losses that happen when towns and villages must relocate. So far, wealthier countries have agreed to keep discussing it, but haven't committed to providing new funding. It's going to require huge investments. There's no getting around it. But there's also a lot of money to be made eliminating emissions from the global economy. And experts say the cost of not dealing with this problem could be ruinous. In the United States alone, quickly cutting carbon emissions could grow the country's economy by $3 trillion over the next 50 years, says Deloitte, the consulting firm. On the other hand, not doing enough to respond to climate change could cost the U.S. $14.5 trillion over the same period. At COP27, one of the biggest issues is going to be money that developed countries promised poorer nations years ago to help them cut emissions and adapt to the climate impacts they're already experiencing. Since industrialized nations are responsible for most of the emissions that are making the planet hotter, they pledged $100 billion a year in financing for developing countries by 2020. But rich countries still haven't delivered. Experts say making good on that promise is crucial to keep poorer nations on board with efforts to cut emissions. But they also say that $100 billion is just a fraction of the money the developing world is going to need.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [10.997947692871094, -2.9118056297302246]}, {"title": "Why a Southern California congressional race hinges on Asian American voters", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/07/1134121891/why-a-southern-california-congressional-race-hinges-on-asian-american-voters", "description": "A congressional race in Orange County has become one of the most closely watched contests this election cycle, and will likely trigger a rethink for politicos on how Asian Americans vote.", "content": "From left: Democrat Jay Chen and Republican Rep. Michelle Steel are battling for California's 45th Congressional District, home to the largest Vietnamese community in the nation. Jay Chen's campaign; Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images hide caption From left: Democrat Jay Chen and Republican Rep. Michelle Steel are battling for California's 45th Congressional District, home to the largest Vietnamese community in the nation. Little Saigon in Orange County, Calif., boasts the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam. Democrat and congressional hopeful Jay Chen showed up one day in September, dressed in his uniform from the U.S. Navy Reserves. He was there to visit the Museum of the Republic of Vietnam, a one-room collection of artifacts donated by veterans and refugees of the country's civil war, tucked in the back corner of one of the shopping centers. Qu\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n, one of the founders of the museum, showed Chen around. A local reporter for a Vietnamese-language paper tagged along. \"When politicians come by, they always bring their own newspaper people,\" Nguy\u1ec5n said. Candidates come to such local highlights \u2014 and make a point of commemorating their visits in the press \u2014 because Vietnamese Americans make up the largest Asian American voting bloc in the area, a constituency that can swing an election. In the newly drawn congressional district of CA-45 that Chen is running in, they comprise 16% of all voters. Other key AAPI groups in the area include people of Korean, Chinese and Indian descent \u2014 together accounting for a third of all registered voters. Chen is Taiwanese American, and he is running against Republican incumbent and Korean American Michelle Steel. The election is a truly California affair: intersectional and immigrant, where race and political identity meet. The fight for Orange County underscores the complexity of the Asian American vote. Demographics are not destiny here \u2014 both Republican and Democratic strategists can pull data suggesting an AAPI swing one way or the other. It has become one of the most closely watched congressional races this election cycle, and will likely trigger a rethink for politicos on how they've traditionally surveyed Asian Americans. \"We're at a point now in our community where we can elevate two Asian Americans from both parties,\" Chen said. \"But I think we also have to look beyond that and recognize that it's the issues that matter, and hopefully Asian Americans are at a point where we don't vote just on a party or on an ethnicity, but we're voting based on what these individuals would do for the community.\" Nationally, Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing groups of the U.S. electorate, with record voter turnout in 2020. Experts say the voting bloc cares about the same domestic issues as other voters. But with overseas connections still strong for many, especially first-generation voters, U.S. foreign policy ends up playing an unusual role in Asian American voter choice, a phenomenon known as homeland politics. The term describes how the political choices of immigrants are influenced by their attachments and concerns about their home country. The Museum of the Republic of Vietnam, for example, underscores the enduring ties people have to a place an ocean away, and suggests that current affairs in Asia remain a concern to many. \"China continues to be a key issue for Vietnamese American voters, particularly those concerned with nation-state or trade issues,\" explained Long Bui, a political science professor at UC Irvine who studies Asian American populations. In contemporary geopolitics, Vietnam resents China's naval activities in waters it considers its own, and distrusts the growing power of the Chinese Communist Party. Little data is available tracking Asian American sentiment in this way, and surveys often do not account for differences within diaspora groups. Polls, for instance, jumble those from Taiwan under the umbrella \"Chinese American\" category \u2014 which, given Beijing's threats against Taipei and growing numbers of Taiwanese who reject that identity, fail to capture that group's assessment of the rise of China \u2014 one that is markedly different from immigrants directly from the People's Republic of China. For many Americans who have fled authoritarian states, there is often a preference for the party they believe has a tougher approach to non-democratic states. \"The Vietnamese American community really pays attention to U.S. foreign policy towards Chinese Communist expansion in the Asia-Pacific region,\" said Tri Ta, Republican mayor of Westminster, and supporter of the Steel campaign. \"We are strongly anti-Communist.\" Asian American Republicans may push that narrative, but the picture is complex. In the 2020 election, two-thirds of Asian Americans voted for Joe Biden; Donald Trump likely lost supporters with his anti-Asian rhetoric, particularly surrounding COVID-19 (\"Chinese virus,\" \"kung flu\"). But it's also true that in the same election, the GOP flipped two seats in California, ousting Democratic incumbents. Rep. Michelle Steel (2nd L) talks with reporters during a news conference with (L-R) House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, Rep. Mike McCaul and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise following a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center on October 20, 2021 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption Two Asian American women from Orange County won those districts: Michelle Steel and Young Kim. For many years, Kim had served as the outreach director and head of Asia affairs for now-retired Congressman, Ed Royce, and became a fixture in the AAPI community. While voters care most about domestic issues, both also campaigned as anti-Communist hawks. In Congress, Steel sits on the Congressional Executive Commission on China, which monitors Chinese human rights violations, while Kim has introduced bills such as the DICTATOR Act, which calls for investigating China's potential assistance to Russia in evading war sanctions. Encouraged by their success and in a drive to appeal to more AAPI voters, the Republican National Committee (RNC) opened a field office in Little Saigon last year. It's one of several across the country that the GOP has set up. \"The RNC has invested millions in authentically engaging with Asian Pacific Americans,\" said Nainoa Johsens, director of Asian Pacific American Media at the RNC. \"We are putting down roots in the community, having conversations, and earning votes.\" According to AAPIData , support for Democrats has dropped some 10 percentage points since 2020, though Asian Americans still lean Democrat. While the economy, education and crime are some of the group's top concerns, a majority of those polled also said U.S. foreign policy and national security are \"very important\" or \"extremely important\" to them, and AAPI voters remain split over which party is doing a better job on those two issues. \"This group is up for grabs,\" said Cliff Li, Executive Director of the National Committee of Asian American Republicans. But, he warned, \"It's so diversified you've got to do tons of homework to get to them.\" In CA-45, that means appealing to anti-Communist feelings among Vietnamese Americans. Wartime family histories also mean a common pro-military stance, which is where Chen and his service with the U.S. 7th Fleet could resonate. \"You have this Vietnamese community that's very cognizant of China's claims to the South China Sea, and just China's overall menacing presence,\" Chen said. \"And for the Taiwanese Americans also, this is top of mind.\" At times, it feels as if the two candidates are working to outdo the other with their tough-on-China credentials \u2014 and to cast suspicion on the other. Chen speaks at a veterans' event for his campaign. A member of the U.S. Navy Reserves, he has been emphasizing his military credentials to more moderate and conservative Asian Americans \u2014 and how he cares about their homeland politics. Jay Chen's campaign hide caption Steel recently sent out mailers to voters in Little Saigon suggesting Chen is sympathetic to China and is a Communist \u2014 complete with a doctored photo of him holding The Communist Manifesto. The Steel campaign cites his vote from a decade ago while on a local school board to work with the Confucius Institute, a Chinese government language outreach program that has since come under scrutiny for its attempts at some locations to censor criticism of China's human rights record. Chen has hit back, pointing out that Steel voted against the CHIPS Act, a multi-billion dollar government investment to catapult America's semiconductor industry, and a parry against China's own ambitions. Steel has only doubled down, recently airing an ad where two actors playing Chinese spies crow that Chen is \"one of us.\" The spot has received backlash from the Asian American community, including a rebuke from Committee of 100, which represents prominent Chinese Americans. Steel declined to be interviewed for this piece. Both candidates must tread with care and consider each slice of the AAPI community. Chinese Americans, for example, have \"a unique situation being sandwiched between two superpowers,\" said Li of the National Committee of Asian American Republicans. Many want to see improved relations between the United States and China. And for younger Asian Americans, \"homeland politics\" may not even play a role in their election decisions. \"There is an intergenerational dialogue happening now, where liberal ideas are on the rise but traditionalist ones have not yet been eclipsed,\" said Bui at UC Irvine. This group cares about social issues such as abortion and anti-racism. That too, must enter the calculus for candidates hoping to win here. Sunny Park, a Democrat and mayor of Buena Park in CA-45, sees a future where Democrats will gain in the once-conservative bastion where Richard Nixon was born and where Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1984 presidential reelection campaign. Actively mentoring future political leaders, Park said she's \"been working with other female political candidates in many other cities in Orange County.\" Until then, however, Orange County remains fluidly purple. For Chen, that means making that pitch to more moderate and conservative Asian Americans by emphasizing his military credentials \u2014 and how he cares about their homeland politics. \"I have a top secret security clearance,\" he said. \"I've served on the Korean Peninsula.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [25.28064727783203, 3.0995476245880127]}, {"title": "100 years after unearthing King Tut's tomb, archaeologists make new discoveries", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/07/1134653074/100-years-king-tut-tomb-egypt-stolen-jewelry", "description": "Uncovered coffins, papyrus documents and other artifacts have recently been found at the Saqqara site in Giza, Egypt.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images hide caption Crates are brought out of King Tut's tomb in 1923, shortly after its discovery. A century after the discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb , archaeologists are still unearthing more artifacts \u2014 and controversies. The unearthing of King Tut's tomb on Nov. 4, 1922 is considered one of the greatest finds in modern history. But archaeologists remained convinced that more remained undiscovered. Now, Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former state minister for antiquities, tells NBC News that archaeologists have recently uncovered coffins, papyrus documents and other artifacts at the Saqqara site in Giza, near the country's capital. The findings are believed to have been associated with another pharaoh, King Teti, as well as generals and advisers of King Tut. Hawass told NBC that the artifacts will be displayed at the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, which is scheduled to open next year \u2014 though it has faced repeated delays. The new museum is planned to be the largest archaeological museum in the world. It will give viewers a view of the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. Also coinciding with the anniversary of the discovery, an Egyptology professor now claims that British archaeologist Howard Carter, who led the original excavation into King Tut's tomb, may have stolen jewelry that belonged to the boy pharaoh. Professor Marc Gabolde of Paul-Val\u00e9ry University of Montpellier in France used photos taken when King Tut's tomb was originally discovered to show that parts of a collar worn by the pharaoh matched those up for auction and in museums, according to Live Science. Parts of the collar are now on display at a museum in Kansas City, Mo., while beads from Tutankhamun's tomb are now at a St. Louis museum. The boy pharaoh took the throne more than 3,000 years ago at just 9 years old and reigned for less than a decade. It's likely that King Tut spent a life in pain due to a cleft palate, curved spine and weakened immune system before dying from malaria and a broken leg, according to one study. And while the discovery of his tomb remains a monumental find, Egyptian officials have spent decades convinced there was more to uncover. A controversial theory that his tomb first belonged to a relative, Queen Nefertiti, ended after researchers concluded four years ago that there were no hidden chambers or tombs at the same site .", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [5.524131774902344, -3.494861125946045]}, {"title": "Be patient: This election is probably going to go on a while", "link": "https://www.npr.org/2022/11/07/1134646535/election-results-delay", "description": "Election Day is Tuesday, but expect this election to go on a while.

It was the last day for early voting in the state. Election Day is Tuesday, but with early voting, the more accepted use of mail voting and the prospect of razor-thin races, it's really Election Season. And Tuesday only marks the beginning of the next phase in that season. Gird for many of these elections to go on for days, if not weeks. This is all perfectly normal when there are close elections. It doesn't mean that there is fraud \u2013 despite the lies about his 2020 loss that former President Trump has pushed and so many candidates he's backed have promulgated. Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to take back the House. They're in the driver's seat and widely expected to reach that and then some. But the full extent of a GOP wave, if there is one, or whether Democrats pull off the surprise and hold the House, won't be known for a while. Many of these races are expected to be close and will take a while to count all the vote. There are lots of competitive seats in California, for example. California polls don't close until 11 p.m. ET, so don't expect many of those to be known on Election Night. In past years, that's been the case, and it's taken a long time to know results \u2013 days and weeks. For the Senate, all eyes are going to be on four states \u2013 Pennsylvania and Georgia in the East and Arizona and Nevada in the West. In Georgia, there's a libertarian on the ballot, who very likely will serve as a place for protest vote \u2013 meaning neither the Democrat nor Republican in the race might surpass the 50% threshold required to win the election outright. If that happens, the election would go to a Dec. 6 runoff, which means control of the Senate quite possibly won't be known for a month after Election Day. People wait in line to vote Saturday at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. Sean Rayford/Getty Images hide caption People wait in line to vote Saturday at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. Recent years have seen a rise in mail voting , and states have different rules for when those mail ballots are due. States have different procedures for when those ballots can be taken out of their envelopes to be processed and tallied, and this can lengthen the count. Let's look at five states, all with crucial Senate races, where there could be delays and confusion: Pennsylvania is one of the places we're expecting to see a pretty dramatic shift on Election Night. Vote tallying should be faster this year than in 2020, considering there will be fewer mail-in ballots likely, but those mail ballots will still take longer and will lead to confusion. Beware a \"Red Mirage\" and a later \" Blue Shift .\" Lots of mail-in ballots will be reported early, and we know that Democrats have been far more likely to say they will be voting early or by mail. That could initially make it look like a Democratic lead, but then in-person ballot results will come in, likely showing Republicans pulling ahead in a close race. Then the rest of the mail ballot results will trickle in later in the evening because they take longer to tabulate and will likely favor Democrats and shift things even more. And Philadelphia simply takes a very long time to report its results. This is what always happens. It is not nefarious. Wisconsin doesn't allow election officials to begin processing mail ballots until polls open on Election Day. Also, if Milwaukee (high concentration of Black voters) and Dane (University of Wisconsin, younger and more liberal voters) take a longer time to report, then you could see another Red Mirage. Arizona saw a slow trickle in Trump's favor in 2020 as the hours went on. But others years have seen the opposite. It's unclear which way the shift will go this year, but there will probably be one. The 2020 presidential was called at almost 3 a.m. ET, but the vote counting continued for days and Biden's lead, though it held up, continued to shrink. Ultimately, the state was decided by just 0.3 percentage points, and Arizona has recently switched to automatic recounts for any contest that's separated by 0.5% or less. Arizona has been ground zero for election denialism with counts and recounts and an attempt at putting a fake slate of electors up in favor of Trump. So in addition to the close vote, the challenges and noise that will happen around the legitimacy of the vote could cause even more chaos. Georgia has seen a huge population shift in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs that have tilted the political hue bluer in recent years. And those suburbs report their results later than rural counties \u2013 so again there could be another Red Mirage here. Nevada is a similar story to Georgia. It's a growth state, and most of that boom has been in Las Vegas, which is in Clark County, the largest population center in the state and where almost 70% of all the state's votes came from in 2020. Clark and Washoe (Reno), which went for Biden in 2020, count more slowly than the more rural counties that will overwhelmingly favor Republicans. Also, post-pandemic, Nevada is one state that has moved toward mail voting. People still have the option to vote in person, but every resident in the state was mailed a ballot unless they chose to opt out of receiving one. Keep in mind also that election officials first report unofficial results. Certified results come days, if not weeks, later. Legal challenges and recounts can also lengthen the time before a winner is determined. Expect that this will go on a while, so patience will be needed in this impatient time.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images hide caption Michigan's only current Black member of Congress, Democrat Brenda Lawrence, is retiring, leaving an open seat to represent much of Detroit. DETROIT \u2014 For the first time in almost 70 years, this traditionally blue city, home to one of the largest African American populations in the nation, will not have a Black Democrat in Congress. Detroiters could elect a Black Republican to the U.S. House. But GOP candidates face a skeptical voting bloc in this Democratic stronghold. It's the first general election since an independent commission redrew Michigan's legislative boundaries, breaking the district covering Detroit into two pieces and adding several suburban areas, split between blue-collar and more affluent communities. Shortly after redistricting, Michigan's only Black member of Congress, Democrat Brenda Lawrence, decided to retire. That left an open seat to represent much of the Motor City. And the candidate who emerged from the district's crowded Democratic primary in August as Lawrence's possible successor is not an African American. At a recent get-out-the-vote rally inside a Detroit high school, Lawrence worried that the city could pay a price if no Black Democrat replaced her. \"I'm the vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,\" she said. \"And I know there are often issues that directly impact us left off the table. If you don't have the Black representation, you don't get a voice.\" Lawrence said some GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill simply avoid her concerns. She noted one recent argument in particular over student debt and income inequality with a U.S. House member who is both Republican and Black. \"And he dismissed it all,\" she said. \"He said, 'Oh that's not an issue. I made it. If anybody wants it they can make it in America.' Just ignoring the fact that there are inherent barriers that the Black community experiences. And as a Black man he just foo-fooed it and walked away.\" Democrats hope to get Black voters, often a backbone of the party, especially in urban areas, engaged in those issues \u2014 and headed to the polls on Election Day. The party has in recent days deployed former President Barack Obama to headline rallies in several cities with significant African American populations. His event in Detroit attracted thousands of people. But Detroit's city clerk predicts only about one-third of the Motor City electorate will actually turn out to vote this year. That would be about 6 percentage points less than in the 2018 midterm election. The Republican running to represent Detroit in Congress says he can overcome apathy among Black voters because, as an African American himself, he walks in their shoes. Martell Bivings is offering a GOP agenda targeting crime and taxes that he maintains Detroiters respond to. He says they just have to overcome being raised in a politically blue city. \"Growing up in a Black family it's kind of like you grow into it, you're born into it,\" he said. \"'You're a Democrat. Shut up.' \" Bivings said it's a different story when he hears Detroiters' concerns over gun violence or rising inflation. \"And some of the things that they would say, I'd say, 'You're saying that and you're a Black man or a Black woman.' And I'd say, 'You're a Republican.' And they'd say, 'Maybe I am.' \" But Bivings likely faces a steep climb translating that into support at the ballot box. More than 90% of Detroit voters cast ballots for Democratic candidates for Congress in 2020 alone. And the Democrat now seeking Detroit's open congressional seat says he, too, connects with the economic fears pervading the community. In this 2018 file photo, state Rep. Shri Thanedar gestures during a debate in Grand Rapids, Mich. Thanedar won Michigan's 13th Congressional Democratic primary on Aug. 2, topping a field of nine candidates in a district that covers most of Detroit and potentially leaving the city next term without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s. Michael Buck/AP hide caption In this 2018 file photo, state Rep. Shri Thanedar gestures during a debate in Grand Rapids, Mich. Thanedar won Michigan's 13th Congressional Democratic primary on Aug. 2, topping a field of nine candidates in a district that covers most of Detroit and potentially leaving the city next term without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s. State Rep. Shri Thanedar has been a ubiquitous presence along the campaign trail, appearing at everything from political fundraisers to modest events at city parks. Thanedar was a poor Indian immigrant who became wealthy by starting a chemical business. He spent millions of dollars of his own money on the primary campaign and defeated eight other contenders, all of them African Americans. Thanedar has a backstory he claims resonates with Detroit voters. \"I grew up in dire poverty,\" he said. \"My district is 20 to 30% at or below poverty level. Economic prosperity is very, very key. We need to bring in good-paying jobs.\" Thanedar's message had traction among some waiting in line at the Detroit high school rally. The idea of economic empowerment attracts voters like Carmen Lewis far more than Bivings' assertion that it takes a Black candidate to understand Detroit. \"We gonna vote for him because he's Black? That ain't got nothing to do with it,\" Lewis said. \"We want people that are gonna work for our city, that's gonna help us grow. Because we're already struggling. We're already hurting. Stuff is high. Children are failing because of the school system. We need help. So, bring somebody in here that's gonna help us, whether they're Black, White, Chinese, Puerto Rican, it doesn't matter.\" That sentiment echoes with Detroit voter Willie Wyatt, who says the colors he's mostly concerned about are red versus blue. The 83-year-old said he felt eternally disenfranchised growing up in the Deep South. That is, Wyatt said, until he watched the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed into law by a Democratic president. \"I don't vote for Republicans. Period,\" Wyatt said. \"And I shouldn't be that hard on people but that's the way I feel. I don't know anything the Republicans ever done for a Black person. Or for that matter anybody else [who's] poor.\" An analysis by the Pew Research Center found about a quarter of the members of Congress identify as an ethnic or racial minority. And the overwhelming majority of them are Democrats. But some African Americans fear Democrats simply take the Black vote for granted.

Sign up here. After securing his iron grip on power in a leadership reshuffle late last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is now moving back onto the world\u2019s stage \u2013 in person \u2013 in an apparent bid to bolster China\u2019s standing amid rising tensions with the West. A handful of state visits in Beijing last week, which included meetings between Xi and leaders of Tanzania, Pakistan, Vietnam and Germany, and expected travel to international summits later this month are a sharp change of pace for Xi, who has drastically limited his foreign guests and only left the country once since start of the Covid-19 pandemic. For more than two years, Xi \u2013 who is the most important figure in China\u2019s Communist Party by a long shot \u2013 hunkered down as China ramped up a stringent zero-Covid policy that seeks to eliminate the virus using border controls, mandatory quarantines, lockdowns and routine mass testing. Germany's leader and top CEOs have arrived in Beijing. They need China more than ever China continues to restrict its citizens under that policy, but Xi\u2019s recent and expected diplomatic schedule suggests he is no longer willing to forfeit his place alongside other world leaders after assuming a norm-breaking third term following the ruling Communist Party\u2019s National Congress last month. There Xi gave a stark assessment of external threats facing China. Those growing challenges stem from \u201ca grim and complex international situation,\u201d with \u201cexternal attempts to suppress and contain China\u201d threatening to \u201cescalate at any time,\u201d Xi told his party members and the nation in a work report delivered during the congress. \u201c(Xi) made it very clear \u2026 that the big challenges China will face (stem from) the less and less conducive international environment \u2013 and that is an area that China must contest,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute. Xi\u2019s apparent ramping up of foreign engagement is likely a bid to counter those headwinds, but also one based on a calculation: \u201cHe must have come to some kind of a conclusion that the risk of Covid is more containable than he had thought before,\u201d according to Tsang. For a leader whose aim throughout his decade in power has been to enhance China\u2019s global stature, a diminished physical presence on the world\u2019s stage \u2013 such as sending his foreign minister to last year\u2019s G20 \u2013 threatens to hinder Xi\u2019s personal diplomacy. Even as other leaders resumed international travel and hosted dignitaries, Xi\u2019s roster of diplomatic events remained largely dominated by remote engagements \u2013 speaking in online summits to the leaders of key partner countries, delivering addresses via video link, taking \u201ccloud\u201d group photos with counterparts at virtual events \u2013 in an apparent bid to minimize potential Covid-19 risk. A handful of foreign leaders have met Xi in Beijing this year, marking his first in-person state meetings since 2020. But the vast majority who visited before the party congress were there for Beijing\u2019s Winter Olympics in February. Then, China-friendly nations like Russia and Egypt attended, while the US and its allies launched a diplomatic boycott over China\u2019s human rights record. Xi made his first foray out of the country since the start of the pandemic in September to attend a meeting of the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Uzbekistan. Xi\u2019s foreign affairs priorities in the weeks and months ahead will likely continue to focus on shoring up relationships with friendly nations, experts say, as he finds himself operating in a very different world from the last time he was playing regular host or attending summits like G20 or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders\u2019 summit \u2013 both of which convene later this month and which he is expected to attend, though yet unconfirmed by Beijing. Since then, Western concerns about China\u2019s rising global power have been fanned by Beijing\u2019s close rapport with Moscow, damning reports on China\u2019s human rights record in its Xinjiang region and shrinking liberties in Hong Kong, as well as negative views of how China has handled the pandemic. \u201cThe main challenge that China faces is the deterioration of relations with the US \u2026 With the US being hostile, China faces great headwinds in its relations with the West, especially in terms of decoupling of the economy,\u201d said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. \u201cChina will not directly discuss the US as the competitor, but instead will try to rally support and solidarity from the rest of the world,\u201d she said. Xi\u2019s meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday, the first between Xi and a G7 leader in about three years, may be one aspect of that strategy, as a Germany that is more friendly toward China has the potential to hinder solidarity in an approach toward China from within the European Union, experts say. During his visit, which also included talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Scholz voiced support of economic partnership with China, \u201con equal footing,\u201d but said he raised issues like human rights, market access and the future of self-governing Taiwan, while also stressing that China\u2019s relationship with one EU member affects all. Scholz brought up the responsibility to push for peace in Ukraine, and Xi used the meeting to release what may be his strongest comments about the escalation of the conflict. China and Russia present united front at summit as Ukraine war risks exposing regional divisions Xi called for the international community to \u201coppose the threat or use of nuclear weapons\u201d and prevent a \u201cnuclear crisis in Eurasia\u201d \u2013 drawing an apparent red line, even as China has yet to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbor and as Xi maintains a close rapport with President Vladimir Putin . Scholz, who came in for heavy criticism at home for taking the trip, which was seen by critics as an endorsement of Xi\u2019s rule, said later those comments on nuclear weapons alone made the trip \u201cworth it.\u201d Xi\u2019s strategy in upcoming summits may fall along similar lines. \u201cHe will try to demonstrate that China is still committed to the world, and is ready to assume its due leadership,\u201d said Sun of the Stimson Center. However, there will be challenges, nearly three years into the pandemic, as China\u2019s top leader is only beginning to re-engage in person.

Jeff Chiu/AP hide caption People walk outside Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. BOSTON \u2014 Elon Musk tweeted Sunday that Twitter will permanently suspend any account on the social media platform that impersonates another. The platform's new owner issued the warning after some celebrities changed their Twitter display names \u2014 not their account names \u2014 and tweeted as 'Elon Musk' in reaction to the billionaire's decision to offer verified accounts to all comers for $8 month as he simultaneously laid off a big chunk of the workforce . \"Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying \"parody\" will be permanently suspended,\" Musk wrote. While Twitter previously issued warnings before suspensions, now that it is rolling out \"widespread verification, there will be no warning.\" In fact, \"any name change at all\" would compel the temporary loss of a verified checkmark, the world's richest man said. Comedian Kathy Griffin had her account suspended Sunday after she switched her screen name to Musk. She told a Bloomberg reporter that she had also used his profile photo. \"I guess not ALL the content moderators were let go? Lol,\" Griffin joked afterward on Mastodon, an alternative social media platform where she set up an account last week. Actor Valerie Bertinelli had similarly appropriated Musk's screen name \u2014 posting a series of tweets in support of Democratic candidates on Saturday before switching back to her true name. \"Okey-dokey. I've had fun and I think I made my point,\" she tweeted afterwards. Before the stunt, Bertinelli noted the original purpose of the blue verification checkmark. It was granted free of charge to people whose identity Twitter employees had confirmed; with journalists accounting for a big portion of recipients. \"It simply meant your identity was verified. Scammers would have a harder time impersonating you,\" Bertinelli noted. \"That no longer applies. Good luck out there!\" she added. The $8 verified accounts are Musk's way of democratizing the service, he claims. On Saturday, a Twitter update for iOS devices listed on Apple's app store said users who \"sign up now\" for the new \"Twitter Blue with verification\" can get the blue check next to their names \"just like the celebrities, companies and politicians you already follow.\" It said the service would first be available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. However, it was not available Sunday and there was no indication when it would go live. A Twitter employ, Esther Crawford, told The Associated Press it is coming \"soon but it hasn't launched yet.\" Twitter did not respond on Sunday to an email seeking comment on the verified accounts issue and Griffin's suspension. Musk later tweeted, \"Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That's our mission.\" If the company were to strip current verified users of blue checks \u2014 something that hasn't happened \u2014 that could exacerbate disinformation on the platform during Tuesday's midterm elections. Like Griffin, some Twitter users have already begun migrating from the platform \u2014 Counter Social is another popular alternative \u2014 following layoffs that began Friday that reportedly affected about half of Twitter's 7,500-employee workforce. They fear a breakdown of moderation and verification could create a disinformation free-for-all on what has been the internet's main conduit for reliable communications from public agencies and other institutions. Many companies have paused advertising on the platform out of concern it could become more unruly under Musk. Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity, sought to assuage such concerns in a tweet Friday. He said the company's front-line content moderation staff was the group least affected by the job cuts. Musk tweeted late Friday that there was no choice but to cut jobs \"when the company is losing over $4M/day.\" He did not provide details on the daily losses at Twitter and said employees who lost their jobs were offered three months' pay as severance.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "technology", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [14.880574226379395, -7.401247024536133]}, {"title": "Tom Brady makes more NFL history in Tampa Bay Buccaneers 16-13 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Rams", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/sport/tom-brady-100k-passing-yards-bucs-rams-spt-intl/index.html", "description": "Tom Brady is synonymous with making history.", "content": "Tom Brady is synonymous with making history.

The 43-year-old completed a pass to running back Leonard Fournette in the fourth quarter for a gain of 15 yards to put him over the mark. Before the game, Brady pointed to his current and former teammates when asked about potentially breaking the record. \u201cI think for me it\u2019s a credit to all the guys that I\u2019ve played with, and who have blocked for me, who have caught passes,\u201d Brady told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI think all those things are a great celebration to all those guys. \u201cI think I can\u2019t do [anything] in this league without guys doing what they are amazing at, too. I\u2019m very fortunate to play with great players, people who catch the football, great coaches, and being down here has been an amazing experience for me. \u201cSo I feel like these are all\u2026 they\u2019re great achievements, but for as much as people want to say: \u2018Oh, this is what Tom Brady did,\u2019 in my mind, this is what myself and all these other people who have contributed to my life have done as well.\u201d While the record was a momentous achievement for Brady, it was what the veteran quarterback did against the Rams which was what he was most happy with afterwards. During what looked like it might be another frustrating night for the Bucs having been unable to find a touchdown all evening, Brady was given one more opportunity in the fourth quarter to rescue the game. And in typical Brady fashion, he completed four straight passes \u2013 including a defensive pass interference call \u2013 to move Tampa Bay down the field before connecting with tight end Cade Otton for a one-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left to complete the comeback victory. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the win,\u201d Brady said after the 55th game-winning drive of his 23-year career. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the win, man. I never cared about the [records]. All about the win.\u201d The comeback victory was an important one for the Bucs.

A total lunar eclipse is happening Tuesday, and it might be a good time to catch a peek, because the next one isn't for three years. The initial phase of the eclipse begins at 3:02 a.m. ET, according to NASA . The partial eclipse then begins at 4:09 a.m. ET, when to the naked eye, it looks like a bite is being taken out of the lunar disk. The moon enters totality at 5:17 a.m. ET and will last for about an hour and a half. People in North America, Central America, Colombia, and western Venezuela and Peru will be able to see the eclipse in totality. Those in Alaska and Hawaii will be able to see all stages of the eclipse. For the best view, it is best to be in a dark area with little light pollution. A lunar eclipse happens when the Sun, Earth and moon align. During a full lunar eclipse, the moon falls completely in the Earth's shadow. The phenomenon causes the moon to appear red, often nicknamed a \"blood moon.\" During a lunar eclipse, what little sunlight that's left passes through Earth's atmosphere to get to the moon. The more cloudy or dusty the atmosphere is, the redder the moon looks. \"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA said. The next full lunar eclipse will occur on March 14, 2025, but there will be partial lunar eclipses before then, according to NASA.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "npr", "category": "science", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [7.069057941436768, 21.436756134033203]}, {"title": "How the weather could impact Election Day 2022", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/how-the-weather-could-impact-election-day-2022/", "description": "\"Higher turnout means inevitably you have less of the party faithful. The smallest of factors could impact turnout, and that even includes the weather,\" Richards said.", "content": "A busy election cycle means millions of voters will cast ballots that will determine the balance of power for the next two years, but political experts say Mother Nature might have a say in which races may see a higher turnout. On Tuesday, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, and voters will decide on 35 seats in the Senate. Many of the races are considered to be a dead heat, and it could come down to turnout that will decide who controls the legislative branch. Dr. David Richards, an associate professor and political chair at the University of Lynchburg, is watching a slew of races closely and said that the smallest impacts could significantly influence who will claim victory. \u201cHigher turnout means inevitably you have less of the party faithful. The smallest of factors could impact turnout, and that even includes the weather,\u201d Richards said. A collaborative study published in The Journal of Politics found that the correlation between bad weather and voter turnout may be more than a fluke theory that is trotted out as a talking point every November. The authors found that voter participation dropped off about one percent per inch of rain, and snowfall decreased turnout by nearly half a percent for every inch of accumulation. Research published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology found that voter turnout increased by 0.14% for every 1.8 \u00b0F jump in temperature. Additionally, the research found that warmer temperatures generally increased the likelihood that voters kept the incumbent party in power. \u201cGenerally, the trend of more and more early voting means weather on Election Day plays a smaller and smaller role, but there are some caveats. The less dedicated often now wait until Election Day if they vote at all, meaning any weather setback, like rain or cold, will be more likely to put off these more casual voters,\u201d Richards stated. Here are the five things to know about the forecast for Election Day. Most communities east of the Rockies will see temperatures either at or above average due in part to a massive ridge of high pressure. Temperatures in the 60s could reach as far north as South Dakota, and the Ohio Valley is expected to see temperatures reach the 70s on Election Day. Richard believes the warm weather could help keep turnout high in several eastern states but warns due to early voting, there will come a point when turnout begins to taper off well ahead of the scheduled precinct closing times. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, Georgia and Florida voting has been strong, but because of sheer numbers, turnout on Election Day will be lower because you run out of interested voters at some point,\u201d Richards said. History will be in the making in the skies as the first visible lunar eclipse on a major Election Day in the U.S. takes place. The moon will briefly be covered by the Earth\u2019s shadow as the sun and the moon align with our planet. The eclipse is expected to begin around 5:17 a.m. EST and peak just before 6 a.m. on Tuesday. The celestial event will be over before the polling precincts open at 7 a.m. on the East Coast, but Richards warns people might hark back to the saying there \u201cmust be a full moon\u201d if something unexpected happens in the political world. People regularly associate odd occurrences with the full moon, but there is little truth to the folklore. \u201cStudies have found minor effects on circadian rhythms. Significant enough they have found patterns but not significant enough that force people got nuts or something similar to that,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIf people are paying attention to it, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018okay, here\u2019s an election where these two events are happening.\u2019 It is an interesting coincidence but nothing more than that,\u201d Richards said. A non-tropical low-pressure system is expected to develop over the southwest Atlantic and meander off the coast of the Southeast. Depending on the exact location of the low and a pressure gradient that forms north of the center, blustery conditions and scattered showers are expected to develop. If the low ventures close to shore, scattered showers from the Carolinas to Florida are possible. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address.

The FOX Forecast Center said the National Hurricane Center is monitoring the potential disturbance for the chance of tropical or subtropical development, but even if the system earns a name, the impacts are expected to remain the same. A significant storm system could be underway across the Rockies and the West that could cause some turbulent weather. Forecast models show rain in lower valleys and snow in higher elevations. The weather system will enable a continued stormy pattern and help the cooler weather prevail for large parts of the region.

And that\u2019s putting it euphemistically, given there are guys who dedicate entire segments of their week to trolling me online. Frankly, it makes sense. A lot of what I talk about here is still taboo \u2013 my work is often the first instance men have had a woman tell them they\u2019re not actually very good at sex. Which is a hard pill to swallow when you\u2019ve grown up in a culture that teaches you to equate sexual performance with masculinity; a construct of manhood that\u2019s so precarious, we\u2019ve invented entire narratives to protect it. The story of the pathologically low female libido, for example, is pervasive not because it\u2019s based in science, but because it\u2019s vastly more palatable to men. Research confirms women want significantly more sex than their partners think they do, and spend more time consuming X-rated content than men (at least, according to a decade of data from PornHub). It\u2019s also women, not men, who are the largest consumers of sexual devices. The reality a lot of men don\u2019t want to face, is women do like sex. Just not the kind they\u2019re having in their relationships. A post shared by Nadia Bokody (@nadiabokody) We see this manifest as sex-starved marriages (which sex therapists typically define as sex 10 or fewer times per year) \u2013 a phenomenon we\u2019ve been made to believe is the result of a broken sex drive epidemic that strangely only seems to affected coupled-off heterosexual women. And though we\u2019ve normalised hurried transactional acts like the non-reciprocal \u201cblowjob\u201d which Sex & The City\u2019s Samantha Jones famously described, saying: \u201cthey don\u2019t call it a \u2018job\u2019 for nothing\u201d, and routine \u201cquickies\u201d (sex lasting just a few minutes and not involving foreplay), these passionless exchanges are often evidence of the beginning stages of sexual dissatisfaction for women. Of course, sporadic unreturned oral or quickies needn\u2019t be viewed as sexual red flags on their own (conversely, they may even revive a flatlining sex life). But a noticeable shift to consistently rushed or performative intimacy, sans mutual stimulation and opportunities for closeness, is almost always a reliable sign a woman has checked out. \u201cI can tell you that when my husband and I were having shower-only quickies it was because I didn\u2019t really want to have to sex,\u201d a female Redditor explains, in a response to a post in which a man asks if he should be worried his wife exclusively wants efficient sex. \u201c[She] really only wants 3-4 min quickies mostly in the shower with a vibrator. I\u2019m talking zero foreplay, touching kissing etc. just get it done \u2026 we don\u2019t even look at each other,\u201d the male poster confesses. It\u2019s a scenario uncomfortably familiar to a lot of women, and something colloquially referred to as \u201cduty sex\u201d in conversations among female friends. \u201cIn the past I\u2019ve become like her in relationships where I\u2019ve lost all physical and/or sexual attraction to my partner,\u201d another woman reveals. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten like this with my [significant other] because I get no emotional intimacy outside the bedroom \u2026 the act itself sucks so at this point I just want to orgasm and be done with it,\u201d a fellow female Redditor agrees. Unfortunately, because we live in a culture dedicated to sheltering men\u2019s egos, these dutiful, disconnected sexual experiences are worryingly ubiquitous among women. And while shortsighted male readers interpret my recognition of this truth as an attack on their gender, I don\u2019t believe (nor have I ever believed) we can simplify this down to an issue with men. Especially given how spectacularly we fail to equip them with the tools for having healthy sexual and relational experiences with women. Arousal doesn\u2019t begin for a woman in the removal of clothes, as men are led to believe. It\u2019s a deeply contextual process, powerfully influenced by what happens outside the walls of the bedroom, in her relationship. At the heart of \u201cduty sex\u201d isn\u2019t a woman bereft of sexual desire. It\u2019s a woman who feels unseen. As one female Redditor explained to the man asking for advice on getting his quickie-focused wife more engaged in sex: \u201cTalk to her. In a location that can\u2019t end in sex. Tell her that you miss the intimacy and connection, can you start dating more, touching more that doesn\u2019t lead to sex eg. Massages, baths, hand holding while walking \u2026 go back to square one of romancing.\u201d This isn\u2019t the message a lot of men want to hear. Largely because it requires emotional labor that\u2019s historically not been required of them, and an acknowledgment of their partner\u2019s sexual dissatisfaction \u2013 something women typically protect men from confronting. So, as I sign off for another week, I\u2019m very aware there will be more than a few male readers who won\u2019t like me. And honestly? That\u2019s fine.

We played together a lot, and even when we made new friends and grew different interests, we promised to always have each other\u2019s backs. In high school, I befriended and eventually started dating a girl my family adored, my sister included. After nine years, we have finally become engaged, but now my sister has grown hostile toward us. She never hinted that she disliked my fiancee before, and nobody in our family can get a reason from her. My mother wants her to be part of our wedding, but with this change in her behavior, I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea. Did I do something wrong? Should I question her to get to the bottom of this? \u2014 BAFFLED BROTHER DEAR BAFFLED: Definitely do that. If you approach it privately, your sister may be more comfortable answering you honestly. It may be she\u2019s afraid of losing the close relationship she has enjoyed with you all these years. If that\u2019s the case, you may be able to reassure her. If it\u2019s something else she might be reluctant to discuss in the presence of other relatives, talking one-on-one will better your chances of getting her to disclose what\u2019s bothering her. DEAR ABBY: I\u2019m a 59-year-old single man who was dating a 42-year-old woman for the past three years. The whole time we dated she was going through a divorce. I supported her and helped her through it. The papers were signed four months ago. Her relationship with her ex started when she was 16 and lasted 26 years. They have a 14-year-old daughter together. Their relationship was emotionally abusive. We had a lot in common and loved doing things together, but our relationship was rocky. During the time we were together, we split up three times because she would get upset with me over simple things but would never have a conversation to try and work it out. She has a short fuse and her temper goes from zero to 60 in a heartbeat. Our fourth argument was our last. She told me to take my things and get out. I love her, and when I told her so many times, she would respond the same. I love her more than I can explain in words. I\u2019m not her ex. I\u2019m nothing like him. I\u2019ve done things for her that any woman would melt over. She told me on my way out the door that she doesn\u2019t want a relationship and never did. She wants to be left alone. After all the time I invested in us, I was crushed. We are still friends on Facebook. If I text her, she will read it but won\u2019t respond. Should I give up and move on, or let her figure her life out and hope she realizes we had something special? \u2014 PUSHED ASIDE IN PENNSYLVANIA DEAR PUSHED ASIDE: When a woman with a fuse that goes from zero to 60 in a heartbeat tells you she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you and never did, it\u2019s safe to conclude that for the past three years you have been used. Has it occurred to you that the verbal abuser in her past relationship may have been her? Please , for your own sake, take the hint. Look for someone who will appreciate and return the love and kindness you offer. Although you may not think so now, you have just dodged a bullet.

A judge set her bond at $10,000. Rosing, who is white, stumbled into the university\u2019s Boyd Hall appearing highly intoxicated, according to the student who was working at the dormitory\u2019s front desk.

Early this morning, a disturbing incident was captured on video in a residence hall. The video is deeply offensive, and we take it very seriously. \u201cNope,\u201d Rosing replied. \u201cYou\u2019re a n\u2014-r and you\u2019re a b\u2014h.\u201d \u201cOh Jesus lord, I do not get paid enough for this,\u201d Spring calmly replied. \u201cI got this all on video,\u201d another voice off-camera said. Spring and another student tried to place Rosing into a seat, but she instead swung at them and kicked Spring. She then tried to push a shopping cart at them, according to additional footage. Spring said Rosing punched her multiple times, kicked her in the stomach and bit her arm while ordering to her to do her chores. \u201cThe girl starts saying things like \u2018do my chores,\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re Black,\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re ugly,\u2019 and at this point she\u2019s like singing the n-word,\u201d Spring said.

As an officer placed Rosing\u2019s hands behind her back and handcuffed her, she said repeated the n-word in a sing-song tune. \u201cHey, guess what? You\u2019re going to jail,\u201d the arresting officer told the vile student, who refused to provide her name. Spring said Rosing even kicked and bit a police officer, leading to her assault to an officer charge. The University of Kentucky condemned the assault in a statement Sunday morning. \u201cEarly this morning, a disturbing incident was captured on video in a residence hall,\u201d the university said. \u201cThe video is deeply offensive, and we take it very seriously.\u201d The school said that its Office of Student Conducting is conducting an immediate review and that its Student Success teams have reached out to the victims to offer support. \u201cThe safety and well-being of our students is our top priority, and we will not tolerate behavior that threatens it,\u201d the University of Kentucky said. UK President Eli Capilouto also sent a message to the university community saying there will be a full investigation. Spring said more needs to be done to ensure that students don\u2019t face racist attacks on campus moving forward. \u201cThe problem here is that this happens way too much on college campuses for things to not be done and we get these emails and everything about how [the university doesn\u2019t] tolerate it, but it\u2019s still happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like at this point, the attention needs to be shifted from the offenders to the offended.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [8.658452033996582, 8.411336898803711]}, {"title": "Political experts issue midterm election predictions, most conclude GOP will take House and Senate is toss-up", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/political-experts-issue-midterm-predictions-most-conclude-gop-take-house-senate-remains-toss-up", "description": "Political experts are divided over who will control the Senate following Tuesday's midterm elections, but most believe Republicans will take the majority in the House.", "content": "close Video Democrats, Republicans bring familiar faces to Pennsylvania campaign trail Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports from Bucks County, Pennsylvania on how Democrats and Republicans are making a last-minute push in the Keystone State on 'America Reports.'

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leadership has repeatedly consulted left-wing environmental groups tied to a massive liberal dark money network on policy matters, according to internal agency documents obtained by Fox News Digital. EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who President Joe Biden picked to lead the agency in early 2021, has met with leaders of green groups \u2014 including the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and League of Conservation Voters (LCV) \u2014 which have received funding from both the massive Arabella Advisors-managed dark money network and liberal Swiss donor Hansjorg Wyss' funding network, according to emails and calendar entries reviewed by Fox News Digital. The groups Regan engaged with have aggressively opposed fossil fuel development via litigation and lobbying efforts. Experts have argued that rushing away from fossil fuels to more unreliable forms of energy like wind and solar will lead to higher consumer prices and greater likelihood of blackouts during periods of high electricity demand. \"It's so disappointing to see the Biden administration engaging with these extremist groups that push an unfounded ideology that is all about making fossil fuel energy \u2014 that literally runs our entire economy \u2014 more expensive and less accessible,\" Mandy Gunasekara, a Heritage Foundation visiting fellow who served as the EPA's chief of staff during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

The first meeting, in March 2021, involved two other senior EPA officials, while the second, in October 2021, was a one-on-one phone call. In April 2021, Regan delivered remarks to an NRDC panel event and, in September, he participated in a one-on-one video call with NRDC President Manish Bapna.

I was from a disadvantaged and not well-connected family, and my education suffered as a result. Education is a key issue for Hispanics in the midterm elections. (iStock) Yet when I came to this country, like many Hispanics, I realized my story was not uncommon. And I recognized that the surest way to attain the American Dream is to gain access to a good education. The truth is, Hispanic students often face barriers decreasing their opportunities at a quality education. Language barriers, financial struggles, restricted internet connection and lack of access to devices at home are common obstacles for Latino students. The actions of the education establishment over the last few years made these challenges much worse, resulting in record gaps in reading for Hispanic fourth-grade students in 38 of the 50 states, according to the latest Nation\u2019s Report Card (NAEP) scores. Like any parent, I do not want my children's dreams crushed, or for them to be forced to endure subpar circumstances because their schools are not the right fit for them. I do not want my community to continue to be misled by broken promises from leaders who believe in funding only institutions and not students. I want trailblazers willing to step out in a bold way for educational empowerment, historic per-pupil funding, and opportunity regardless of a child\u2019s zip code or economic status. Hispanic-Americans are proud of their heritage and have made countless contributions to this great country. Many have left their native lands to better themselves and their families. We have grown to become the second-largest group of eligible voters and the fastest-growing ethnic group in the U.S. And with nearly 35 million Latinos eligible to vote this year, we account for 14% of a crucial voting bloc. We have become such an important voting bloc that we finally have an opportunity to make our voices \u2013 and vote \u2013 count. Video News story after news story is focusing on this phenomenon and the issues that are critical to us. In a recent Pew Research poll, education is a leading issue at 70%, just after the economy at 80%. Hispanic voters are not alone \u2013 education has taken center stage for most voters. Maybe After enduring significant losses in learning and academic achievement gaps during the pandemic, voters are seeing NAEP scores that show 51 percent of Hispanic fourth graders not mastering basic math concepts. With two decades of educational progress nearly gone, voters are stepping up to call on elected officials to stop making excuses for the deficient public education system and how badly it failed students during the pandemic and before. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER With the failures of traditional public schooling, thousands of children are being left behind, and for too many Democrats and some Republicans, the answer is to quiet the parents, expand the broken system, and sweep the failures under the proverbial rug, hoping no one is paying attention. I left the Democratic Party because in my state of Nevada, the party has chosen the unions over parents. Voters in some states or districts have the luxury of choosing among candidates in both parties who support choice, but in the Silver State, the choice was made for me. I was tired of hearing the arguments against school choice, the focus on spending more on a system that was failing my community, and knowing stifling of real solutions to the inequalities in the system. Couple above the CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We want what is best for our children. I know I do. On November 8, I expect there to be a significant wake-up call for the Democratic Party and any leaders who are still loyal to the teachers\u2019 unions.

Though the rumored couple quickly drew scrutiny over their significant age gap, Cher has an established track record of finding love with younger and sometimes much younger men. In 2010, Vanity Fair declared her \"the original cougar, long before Demi Moore and Susan Sarandon made it fashionable.\" And while the Grammy Award winner has a long history of dating men in the music industry, her eclectic roster of lovers also includes A-list actors, a professional hockey player, a bagel baker and a Hell's Angel. In a 2010 interview with Parade, Cher reflected on her colorful love life and expressed that she had no regrets over her past romances. \"I enjoyed them all!\" she told the outlet. \"I never felt I chose badly, and I was always happy when the next man came along. I can usually last about two years with a man, and that\u2019s it. The moment the relationship goes into the phase of more commitment, it changes.\" Here's a look back at the many men who have romanced the icon over the decades. Warren Beatty American actor Warren Beatty poses circa 1962. (Archive Photos/Getty Images) Cher met Hollywood heartthrob Warren Beatty in 1962 when she was 16 and he was 25.

Of course, I'm one of a long list. I did it because my girlfriends were so crazy about him, and so was my mother. I saw Warren, he picked me up and I did it. And what a disappointment! Not that he wasn't technically good, or could be good, but I didn't feel anything. So, for me, I felt, 'There's no reason for you to do that again.'\" Sonny Bono Cher and her first husband Sonny Bono rose to fame as the iconic singing duo Sonny & Cher. (Harry Langdon/Getty Images) The \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" hitmaker was also 16 when she met her future husband Sonny Bono, with whom she would later form the iconic singing duo Sonny & Cher . At the time, Bono was a 27-year-old struggling musician and separated from his first wife, Donna Raskin. \"I swear to God, the moment I saw Sonny, everyone else in the room disappeared,\" Cher told Parade in November 2010. \"He was the coolest guy ever.\" The two started recording together and Cher later moved in with Bono, who divorced Raskin in 1962. Their relationship was platonic at first but eventually blossomed into romance. \"It wasn\u2019t a fiery, sexy thing with us, but rather paternal, like we were bound together, two people who needed each other, almost for protection,\" Cher said in 1975. The two married in 1965 and welcomed their daughter Chastity \u2013 who later transitioned to a man and changed his name to Chaz -- in 1969. However, their marriage hit the rocks in the early 1970s and Bono filed for separation in 1974. Cher later filed for divorce, citing \"involuntary servitude\" as the reason for the couple's split. SONNY BONO TOLD CHER SHE WASN'T' \u2018PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE\u2019 WHEN THEY MET, STAR RECALLS Despite their bitter divorce and ugly custody battle, Cher has said that she was devastated when she learned that Bono had died in a skiing accident in 1998. She gave a heartfelt eulogy at his funeral, during which she described her ex-husband as \"the most unforgettable character I ever met.\" She continued, \"No matter how old I get, no matter how many people I meet, that person will always be Son for me.\" David Geffen The superstar dated music mogul David Geffen, who is now openly gay. (Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) Cher began dating entertainment mogul David Geffen while she was separating from Bono. Though Geffen later came out as gay, Cher said that the two shared a genuine romantic connection. \"I was the first person to share his bed and to share his life,\" Cher said in Thoms R. King's 2001 biography \"The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood.\" \"People don\u2019t believe that, or they don\u2019t want to believe it, or they don\u2019t understand how it could be. But we were really crazy about each other.\" Gregg Allman Cher was married to rocker Gregg Allman from 1975 to 1979.

Nine days after Cher and Allman tied the knot in Las Vegas, she filed to dissolve the union due to her new spouse's drug and alcohol abuse. They reconciled after a month though their marriage was often troubled. Allman planned to file for divorce in 1975 but backtracked after learning that Cher was pregnant. The two welcomed their son Elijah Blue in 1976. The pair collaborated on an album in 1977 under the name \"Allman and Woman\". Their first and only album \"Two The Hard Way\" failed critically and commercially. Cher filed for separation that year and their divorce was finalized in 1979.

Imagine my surprise!\" The magazine issued an update, writing, \"In a Startrack in the Aug. 13 issue, People linked Cher with Eric Stoltz. They are not dating, nor was Stoltz the actor Cher proposed for her leading man in [upcoming movie] Grandview, U.S.A. We apologize for the errors.\" Val Kilmer In a 2021 essay for People magazine, Cher wrote that she still loves ex-boyfriend Val Kilmer. (BACKGRID) When Val Kilmer was a newcomer to Hollywood in the early 1980s, he and Cher, who is 13 years his senior, embarked on a romance. In his memoir \"I'm Your Huckleberry\", Kilmer recalled that the pair met at a birthday party that Meryl Streep threw for Cher in 1981. The two were linked from 1982 to 1984 and in 1985, Cher gushed over Kilmer in an interview with People magazine. \"Val is terrific but sometimes it\u2019s just too intense and hot,\" she told the outlet. \"It\u2019s come the closest to working.\" The singer went on to note that Kilmer had four important qualities: \"sensitive, artistic, humor and he is a great kisser. My rule of thumb, and it\u2019s never failed me, is if a man\u2019s a good kisser he\u2019s a great f--k.\" Last year, Cher reminisced about her romance with the \"Batman Forever\" star in a personal essay that she penned for People. \" He's like nobody I've ever known,\" she wrote. \"He is exasperating and hysterical. Thrilling and funny, and doesn't do what anyone else does. I don't know how we stayed friends, we just did. We didn't try. We just were.\" \"I loved him \u2013 and I love him,\" Cher added.

The allies were initially supposed to run the drills for five days ending on Friday, but extended the training by another day in reaction to the North\u2019s missile tests. On Saturday, the final day of the air force exercises, the United States flew two B-1B supersonic bombers over South Korea in a display of strength against North Korea, the aircraft\u2019s first such flyover since December 2017. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the participation of the B-1Bs in the joint drills demonstrated the allies\u2019 readiness to \u201csternly respond\u201d to North Korean provocations and the U.S. commitment to defend its ally with the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear. Even before the \u201cVigilant Storm\u201d drills, North Korea test-launched a slew of missiles in what it called simulated nuclear attacks on U.S. and South Korean targets in protests of its rivals\u2019 other sets of military exercises that involved a U.S. aircraft for the first time in five years. Some experts say North Korea likely aims to use the US-South Korean military drills as a chance to modernize its nuclear arsenal and increase its leverage to wrest greater concessions from the United States in future dealings. US and South Korean militaries have been expanding their regular military drills since the May inauguration of conservative South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has promised to take a tougher stance on North Korean provocations.

(Jason Hanna/Getty Images) There were 68 pass attempts by Mahomes, who completed 43 of them for 446 yards with one passing touchdown and one interception. He found Travis Kelce 10 times for 106 yards as well as 10 receptions for Juju Smith-Schuster for 88 yards. Mahomes also rushed for 63 yards and a rushing touchdown on six carries. For the Titans, Willis went just 5-for-16 for 80 yards. Also, not a single wide receiver caught a ball from Willis in this game, as his receptions went to tight ends Chigoziem Okonkwo and Austin Hooper as well as Hassan Haskins, a running back. Tennessee relied on their run game \u2013 Derrick Henry had 115 yards on 17 carries and two scores after putting up over 200 last week against the Houston Texans \u2013 and solid defense to deal with the Chiefs, who couldn\u2019t find answers early. But, as the Titans couldn\u2019t put points on the board, it felt like Kansas City would eventually respond. CHIEFS' TRAVIS KELCE THROWS HELMET IN FRUSTRATION AFTER INTERCEPTION There were only two games in his career where Mahomes had fewer than 10 points, so he needed to make something happen in the fourth quarter when the Chiefs took over at their own seven-yard line down 17-9. Mahomes is used to dazzling with his arm, but it was his legs that did most of the work on this drive. On third-and-17, the Titans had a golden opportunity to get the ball back in their hands, but Mahomes scrambled and made a couple defenders miss for 20 yards and the first down.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga) Then, on third-and-nine in Titans' territory, Mahomes found a hole to the right and took it all the way into the end zone for 14 yards to make it 17-15. The two-point conversion saw a couple of flags, but again, Mahomes used his legs to head to the left this time and run it in for the tie. With momentum on their side, and Arrowhead Stadium as raucous as ever, the Titans couldn\u2019t run down the field and quickly gave the ball back to the Chiefs at the two-minute warning. But nothing came out of it as overtime was needed to settle it. The Chiefs burned tons of clock in the first quarter to begin this game, making eight minutes and 13 seconds tick off over 15 plays. Due to penalties in the red zone, they could only get a field goal out of it. However, Mahomes went down the field again and found Mecole Hardman for a seven-yard touchdown pass to make it 10-0 early.

Willis had 16-yard and 17-yard runs, while Henry took one 24 yards to set up a red zone opportunity for Tennessee. TITANS' HOLDING PENALTY ALLOWS CHIEFS ANOTHER SHOT AT TYING GAME, NFL WORLD LEFT PUZZLED After a defensive offside, Henry had a four-yard rush to cut the deficit to three. But Henry wasn\u2019t done finding the end zone. He went 56 yards to kick off the Titans\u2019 next drive and would eventually take the ball just one yard over the goal line for his second touchdown of the day, giving his team a 14-9 lead. A Randy Bullock field goal in the third quarter was all they could generate in the second half, though, as the Chiefs' defense adjusted to the run-heavy offense. Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker also had a rough night prior to the game-winning field goal from 28 yards. He missed an extra point following the Hardman touchdown and couldn\u2019t put a 47-yarder through in the third quarter as well.

Yes, I know. The season is 13 games old. But I\u2019m not quite sure whether the modifier should be \u201conly\u201d 13 games or \u201calready\u201d 13 games. Because just about one-third into 2022-23, the Blueshirts have won fewer than half their contests, the record dropping to 6-4-3 following Sunday\u2019s 3-2 overtime defeat at the Garden to the Red Wings after carrying a 2-0 lead into the second period. I\u2019ll tell you what though, it surely was not too early for head coach Gerard Gallant to drop an inconspicuous Chris Kreider to the fourth line with Ryan Carpenter and Julien Gauthier in a series of line changes in the third period. Kreider\u2019s feet just aren\u2019t moving. This was as dramatic a move as Gallant has made in his regular-season 95-game tenure behind the New York bench. It has probably been a long time coming. \u201cHe deserved to be where he was at,\u201d said the coach. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d The Rangers are in the middle of the pack of those clubs currently outside the playoff cutline, and what\u2019s more \u2014 or less \u2014 is that this team has yet to establish any sort of identity. Mika Zibanejad and Jacob Trouba \u2014 two of the four players who deigned to be available to the media \u2014 talked about how the team knows what its game is and has to get back to it, but that seems a leap of faith at this moment. This isn\u2019t last year\u2019s team. Jaro Halak might have turned in the team\u2019s best netminding performance of the year in this 33-save effort that at least preserved a point but the Blueshirts have not been able to lean on their goaltending as they did through Igor Shesterkin\u2019s Vezina-winning 2021-22 campaign. Indeed, the team ranks 25th in five-on-five save percentage at .906. That was kind of Arizona territory last season. Thirteen games in and it is quite the challenge to be able to identify what this group does notably well. To suggest that the Rangers are not a particularly physical group would be in the running for understatement of the season. They forecheck in spurts. There is too much risk to their puck-management game. They don\u2019t defend the crease especially well. And for a club with as many skilled marquee players, the Rangers are impotent at five-on-five. They left the ice on Sunday 25th in the NHL with 2.1 goals-per-60:00 and also rank 25th in five-on-five goal differential percentage at 44.90, having scored 22 and allowed 27. Their power play, allegedly vaunted, ranks 15th after Sunday\u2019s 1-for-2. These are not numbers befitting a Stanley Cup contender. These are numbers that might not befit a playoff team. The first period represented one of the club\u2019s best of the season, the Blueshirts leading by two goals after 20 minutes for the first time since the second game of the year in Dallas. But their energy dissipated quickly. Their attack went kerflooey. The Red Wings, 7-3-2 and a legit threat to end their six-year postseason drought, took control. Perhaps it is more accurate to suggest the Rangers handed it over, as they did so many times with the puck. There was also an egregious line change by the Zibanejad-Kreider-Kaapo Kakko unit that directly led to the Wings\u2019 2-2 tying goal on a second rebound at 8:37 of the second period that was scored without a Blueshirt forward in the picture. There appeared to be some unawareness in coverage of the first Detroit goal that was scored on a deflection from in front.

Join Post Sports+ for exciting member-only features , including real-time texting with Mollie Walker about the inside buzz on the Rangers. The pace at times, or at least when the Rangers were attempting to weave through the neutral zone, seemed like September. Kreider, who got a season-low 15:03 of ice but did get the first shift of overtime, was fingered more than any other forward by Gallant, who mixed all of his lines. Assistant coach Gord Murphy, who runs the defense, seemingly fingered Zac Jones, No. 6 getting just one shift in the third period, that one coming in the second minute. The line combinations that have been essentially static are not producing. Gallant shifted Alexis Lafreniere to Filip Chytil\u2019s wing in the third while moving Sammy Blais up to Vincent Trocheck\u2019s flank. Artemi Panarin, who can\u2019t seem to get his passes through, skated on Zibanejad\u2019s left. The third period was better than the second but it was not enough. Neither Zibanejad nor Trouba took this one lightly, the captain acknowledging that playing 60 minutes has been a season-long challenge for this group. The Rangers cannot be happy with their state. They are in for a long struggle if things don\u2019t turn rather quickly.

He wasn\u2019t been with the Nets for the start of their current trip \u2014 which opened with wins at Washington and Charlotte \u2014 and instead remained back in Brooklyn. An MRI exam this past week came up clean, and Simmons had his knee drained to get the swelling out.

After missing all of last season and undergoing offseason back surgery, he hasn\u2019t looked as explosive on offense or as impactful on defense. He began the season largely playing point guard before then-coach Steve Nash progressively moved him more off the ball and used him as a playmaking big man.

With Kyrie Irving suspended, Vaughn has started Edmond Sumner at point guard to push the pace and has gone small to help the defense. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s going to be something to be determined,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cI think a big piece of it is seeing Seth [Curry] and see how he fits in with Joe [Harris] and Royce [O\u2019Neale] and our wings, how we still continue to use the energy group that was David Duke and Sumner off the bench. \u2026 So I still want to reward those guys for their effort. But it\u2019d really be to be determined how we fit it all together.\u201d Kessler Edwards (G-League), T.J. Warren (left foot) and Donovan Williams (G-League) all will miss the game Monday. The Nets held the Wizards to 36.1 percent shooting and held the Hornets to 37.2 percent in their past two games. That\u2019s the first time they limited consecutive foes to under 40 percent since Nov. 22-24, 2021. Yuta Watanabe, who was in the closing lineup versus the Hornets on Saturday, has averaged 10.7 points, on 65 percent shooting and 60 percent from 3-point range, in his last three games. Nic Claxton\u2019s 24 blocks through 10 games are the most by a Net since 2015-16, and his 72.7 percent shooting is the best start for the franchise since 2014-15. The Pelicans\u2019 CJ McCollum, who is president of the NBPA, commented on Irving social media promotion an anti-Semitic film. \u201cHe\u2019s displayed empathy now. I think this is a learning experience in which I don\u2019t think he understood the magnitude of the movie,\u201d McCollum said Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he understood the magnitude of the people that were affected, how they were impacted and how fast hate can spread and how this can snowball.\u201d Irving, who has at least three more games left on his suspension, briefly flirted with going to the Lakers this offseason in a sign-and-trade scenario.

The frustration has undoubtedly been building for Halak, who has yet to record a win in a red, white and a blue jersey after he dropped to 0-3-1 on the season despite a 33-save performance in Sunday\u2019s 3-2 overtime loss to Detroit at Madison Square Garden. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a win, so no,\u201d Halak said when asked if he felt this was his most complete game of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning and we lost the game again. It\u2019s nice to get one point, but we want the extra one so.\u201d Halak stood tall for the Rangers in an otherwise dull game, which saw the 37-year-old make eight saves in the third period to help force overtime. During a strong first period as the Rangers built a 2-0 lead, Halak made a handful of key saves to keep Detroit off the board \u2014 particularly on the penalty kill. When Jacob Trouba was in the penalty box for holding just over five minutes in the game, the Slovakian netminder gloved down a one-timer from Detroit captain Dylan Larkin and denied Kubalik at the post. Halak later robbed Lucas Raymond on the doorstep in what appeared to be a sure-thing goal while the Rangers were killing off Filip Chytil\u2019s hooking penalty at 17:30 of the period. It all fell apart for the Rangers in a lackadaisical second period, which saw Detroit bulldoze its way back into the game with two early goals. There was Matt Luff\u2019s redirection that Halak had no way of tracking at 2:46. The Rangers\u2019 forwards then left Zac Jones, Trouba and Halak out to dry in a poorly timed change later in the period, when he made two initial saves before Pius Suter buried the Wings\u2019 third shot to even the score 2-2 at 8:37. \u201cThe second period,\u201d Halak said of where it went wrong for the Rangers. \u201cThe first and third we played good for the most part. The second we kind of gave it to them, too many odd-man rushes in the second. You\u2019re not going to win a game like this.\u201d Filip Chytil, who had missed the prior six games with a suspected concussion sustained in a collision with Cole Sillinger on Oct. 23, was reinserted into his role as third-line center while defenseman Ryan Lindgren was sidelined after sat with an upper-body issue. Chytil\u2019s return bumped veteran Ryan Reaves from the lineup, marking his second healthy scratch of the season.

This was the Bills. Were they banged up? Sure, they were. But so are the Jets.", "content": "There was one more moment left to endure, one more play separating the Jets \u2014 and MetLife Stadium \u2014 from the most satisfying victory in almost seven long years. There were 33 seconds left, and the Jets had nudged the Bills back to their own 14-yard-line, fourth-and-21. Josh Allen was rubbing his right wrist. The stadium was roaring thunder. One more play. One more moment. Allen let one fly, down the left sidelines, where Gabe Davis was battling Sauce Gardner . Jets fans are still programmed to expect this play to end in a variety of ways, none of them especially positive. But the ball hit the turf harmlessly, and 83,135 sets of eyes immediately scanned the vicinity to spot yellow flags. No flags. No miracle for the Bills. Instead there would be a victory formation, the final nail in this 20-17 Jets victory that, when it flashed on scoreboards in stadiums across the NFL right around 4 o\u2019clock Sunday afternoon, had to have people asking themselves: typo? Not a typo. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the prettiest game,\u201d linebacker C.J. Mosley would say, \u201cbut we showed a whole bunch of heart.\u201d They did. They all did. At game\u2019s end, the green-clad defenders among those 83,135 witnesses had drowned out the invading forces of Bills Mafia, and they let loose a snarl that\u2019ll still be heard on the Jersey Turnpike come rush hour Monday. Seven years they\u2019d all waited for a game like this, since Week 16 of 2015, that overtime win against the Patriots that allowed the Jets to dream playoff dreams for seven more days. Seven years, six quarterbacks and three coaches later, the Jets stalked off the field and into their bye week having knocked off the NFL\u2019s consensus team to beat, dragging a 6-3 record into the bye week with a rematch against the Pats awaiting them on the other side of it. \u201cWe know,\u201d quarterback Zach Wilson said, \u201cthat we\u2019re a good team.\u201d \u201cWe knew,\u201d receiver Garrett Wilson said, \u201cthat we wanted to make a statement.\u201d \u201cA lot of people will be surprised by this,\u201d head coach Robert Saleh said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one person surprised about this in our locker room.\u201d Sometimes, the nobody-believes-in-us mantra can be tiresome and manipulative, but in the Jets\u2019 case, it happens to be true. Nobody believed in the Jets at season\u2019s start, when most figured even a huge leap forward might yield five wins if the ball bounced right. Even when the Jets started to collect wins, the skeptics were quick to qualify them: They benefited from a one-in-a-million miracle in Cleveland. The Dolphins and Broncos played backup quarterbacks. Green Bay and Pittsburgh are clearly not nearly the equal of their pedigrees or recent histories. On and on. This was different. This was the Bills. Were they banged up? Sure, they were. But so are the Jets. And the Bills had managed to plow through their first seven games at 6-1 and were 12-point favorites Sunday on merit. They are the presumptive favorites to come out of the AFC. They have Allen. They have all those toys, both sides of the ball. \u201cA great team,\u201d Sauce Gardner said. \u201cA great team.\u201d And yet, the Jets outplayed them in every phase. The defense sacked Allen five times and picked him off twice, and it stubbornly refused to allow the Bills\u2019 pinball-machine offense to get anything close to a rhythm. The offense was mistake free, save for one Zach Wilson strip-sack, and when the game was there to be won, they made like the \u201973 Dolphins and ran the ball on play after play, 12 out of 13 plays, leading to the go-ahead field goal by Greg Zuerlein. And the special teams had a near-perfect day, too, highlighted by a successful fake punt early in the third quarter. And with each possession, the home crowd shook off whatever negative impulses it might\u2019ve had given years of practice and willed the rest to happen. \u201cTheir energy definitely impacted the game,\u201d Gardner said. There have been too few of these kinds of games since MetLife opened its doors a dozen years ago. This was one to savor. This was one to enjoy. The Jets needed to play a near-perfect game to beat the Bills, and they played a near-perfect game. A good day at MetLife. A great day for Jets fans. A wonderful game to take into the bye. \u201cWe don\u2019t flinch,\u201d Saleh said. No, they don\u2019t. They play like they belong again, for the first time in years. They play like a team that\u2019s the equal of 6-3. And they play like a team that deserves to look the Bills in the eye, just a half-game behind them now in the AFC East. Nope.

They took possession of the ball at their own 4-yard line with 7:53 remaining in a 17-17 game and marched \u2014 doing it with a running game that the Buffalo defense couldn\u2019t stop. Using newcomer running back James Robinson, playing in his second game with the team, and Michael Carter, the Jets ran the ball on the first eight plays of the drive for 73 yards. Robinson had 37 of those yards and Carter 36. The Jets didn\u2019t throw the ball on that series until Zach Wilson connected with Denzel Mims for 12 yards to the Buffalo 6-yard line on a third-and-5 play. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t stop it,\u2019\u2019 Tomlinson said of the run. \u201cI think there was a period where I pulled like three times in a row and I was like, \u2018Yeah, if it keeps working, let\u2019s keep doing it.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 They did. The decadent drive began with a key 9-yard run by Robinson that got them out of the shadow of their own goal line. Robinson, who finished with 48 yards on 13 carries and scored a touchdown on a screen pass, would add a 16-yard run after that which was followed on the next play by a 17-yard run by Carter, who finished with 76 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling when you impose your will on an opponent like that and those running backs were hitting it downhill,\u2019\u2019 Tomlinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the best feeling in football when you can just move the ball like that keeping the ball on the ground and feeling like you\u2019re willing yourself down the field,\u2019\u2019 tight end Tyler Conklin said. \u201cShowing up with the run game there on that last drive, just pounding those guys all the way down the field was huge,\u2019\u2019 Wilson said. \u201cIt was devastating, man, because it took like seven minutes off the clock,\u2019\u2019 Carter said. \u201cIt was an important drive to our season so far.\u2019\u2019 Left tackle Duane Brown called the series \u201can O-lineman\u2019s dream,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u201cTo have eight minutes on the clock, starting on your own 5-yard line in a tie game and running the ball, eating up the clock when they knew we wanted to run the ball, there\u2019s nothing like it.\u2019\u2019 Jets head coach Robert Saleh, who\u2019s been on the wrong end of a drive like that, said, \u201cFrom a defensive standpoint, it sucks, I can tell you that much. I\u2019ve always said I\u2019d rather have someone throw for 400, 500 yards than run for 200 or 300 yards.

The team signed Miller to an entry-level contract Friday, prompting criticism from players and comments from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman that the 20-year-old would not currently be eligible to play in the league. Team president Cam Neely said in a statement the Bruins thought Miller\u2019s bullying of Isaiah Meyer-Crothers was an isolated incident and reversed course \u201cbased on new information.\u201d \u201cWe owe it to our fans, players, staff, partners and community to make sure that our practices and protocols are in keeping with the ethos that we demand from ourselves and as an organization,\u201d Neely said. \u201cAs such, we will be reevaluating our internal processes for vetting individuals who wish to earn the privilege of playing in the National Hockey League for the Boston Bruins.\u201d Earlier Sunday, agent Eustace King released a statement saying O2K Sports Management took part in serious deliberation before deciding to represent Miller, saying the defenseman was working with and volunteering for organizations and committed to changing his ways. King did not immediately respond to a message Sunday night seeking comment on the Bruins decision. \u201cBased on new information, we believe it is the best decision at this time to rescind the opportunity for Mitchell Miller to represent the Boston Bruins,\u201d Neely said. We hope that he continues to work with professionals and programs to further his education and personal growth. Boston opting to sign Miller did not go over well with players, from captain Patrice Bergeron down. Bergeron said he was consulted about the possibility and was \u201con the fence.\u201d \u201cThe culture that we built here goes against that type of behavior,\u201d Bergeron said. \u201cIn this locker room, we\u2019re all about inclusion, diversity, respect.\u201d Boston forward Nick Foligno called the signing \u201chard to swallow.\u201d \u201cTough thing to hear for our group,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie to you. I don\u2019t think any guy was too happy.\u201d The Coyotes picked Miller in the fourth round of the 2020 draft despite knowing of his 2016 assault conviction. The team parted ways with Miller amid criticism after learning more about the bullying. The University of North Dakota announced a day later that Miller was no longer with the school\u2019s hockey team. Miller pleaded guilty at age 14 to one count of assault and one count of violation of the Ohio Safe Schools Act. He and another teenager were accused of making Meyer-Crothers eat a candy push pop after wiping it in a bathroom urinal, and surveillance video showed them kicking and punching him. Meyer-Crothers\u2019 mother Joni told The Arizona Republic that Miller started bullying her son in second grade and used racial epithets. Miller sent a letter to all 31 NHL teams acknowledging what happened and apologizing for his behavior. Joni Meyer-Crothers said Miller never personally apologized to Isaiah or their family other than a court-mandated letter. \u201cWhen I was in eighth grade, I made an extremely poor decision and acted very immaturely,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cI bullied one of my classmates. I deeply regret the incident and have apologized to the individual. Since the incident, I have come to better understand the far-reaching consequences of my actions that I failed to recognize and understand nearly seven years ago.\u201d Miller sat out the 2020-21 season before scoring 39 goals with 44 assists for Tri-City of the USHL in 2021-22. He was named the USHL\u2019s player and defenseman of the year after setting league records for goals and points by a defenseman. \u201cWe are sorry that this decision has overshadowed the incredible work the members of our organization do to support diversity and inclusion efforts,\u201d Neely said, offering his apology to Meyer-Crothers and his family and saying the team stands against bullying and racism. \u201cI think there is a lesson to be learned here for other young people. Be mindful of careless behaviors and going with the group mentality of hurting others. The repercussions can be felt for a lifetime.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-16.93317985534668, -9.784900665283203]}, {"title": "Nets\u2019 Cam Thomas proving value while filling in for Kyrie Irving", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/nets-cam-thomas-proving-value-filling-in-for-kyrie-irving/", "description": "One does not simply replace Kyrie Irving.

But the Nets are showing they might be able to win without him, and Cam Thomas is part of the reason why. Thomas has stepped up in the wake of Irving\u2019s suspension . With the star\u2019s absence indefinite, Thomas has been handed a golden opportunity by interim coach Jacque Vaughn, and is making good on it. \u201cIt means a lot. It was a rough first two, three weeks of the season for me,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo for Coach JV to have trust in me to close the game out, and play me a good amount of minutes these last two games, I can\u2019t thank him enough for that. \u201cAnd I want to thank my teammates too, for trusting me with the ball down the stretch like that, KD [Kevin Durant], of course.\u201d Whether Steve Nash, who was fired Tuesday, would have played Thomas is uncertain, but Vaughn has used the second-year guard, who had been out of the rotation, as a sixth man. The results have been impressive as the Nets prepare to face the Mavericks on Monday. Fresh out of mothballs, Thomas not only performed well in wins at Washington (where he was a +36) and Charlotte, but also he handled endgame situations with aplomb. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to have Cam finish the game. It\u2019s lessons of life. It\u2019s amazing what the difference of a week could look like, what two weeks can look like. And he was ready,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cCam is a hooper. I could take him to Rucker Park, I could take him to Crenshaw. \u2026 He can hoop. An unbelievable job.\u201d It speaks volumes that Thomas stayed ready after logging just 14:39 total in three cameos over the first eight games of the season. Thomas, 21, even briefly changed his Instagram bio to read #freeCT\ufe0f. He also posted to his story a TV clip of an angry man bemoaning how he had sacrificed and done everything asked of him, but gotten nothing in return. Since the suspension of Irving, what Thomas has gotten is a chance. Vaughn didn\u2019t have to tell him \u2014 he knew full well what he had to do with it. \u201cNo, no conversation. Ky went down, so I assumed I was going to have an opportunity to play, so I just want to make the most of it,\u201d Thomas told The Post. \u201cI just stayed ready and was hoping I got the opportunity.\u201d In the past two games, Thomas had 38 points (second on the team to Durant) and shot 3-for-6 from 3-point range and 13-for-14 from the free-throw line. More impressive is how clean and under control he was while still making plays. Thomas had 10 assists and just a single turnover, and was a +49 in 61 combined minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s quiet and doesn\u2019t show much emotion, but he\u2019s always been a high IQ player who watches the game and watches the greats, knows the history of the game,\u201d Durant said. \u201cSo he\u2019s tried to implement some of that stuff. \u201cThis is all about gaining experience. He\u2019s going to need more reps, and you\u2019ll see him getting better and better. But it\u2019s a natural talent, so he can come out there after seven or eight games and just transition smoothly. So we\u2019ll need more from him going forward. He can do more. We\u2019ve got high expectations for him.\u201d Thomas agreed the game is slowing down for him as he gains experience. \u201cYeah definitely just getting a feel for the NBA game, picking the game apart,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cIt helps the scoring come easier when you pick the game apart like that. I just want to keep improving what I did.\u201d He has earned enough respect that, with Irving out, the Nets are running a lot of two-man actions with Thomas and Durant. \u201cI\u2019m just reading the game,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cCoach JV draws it up for us to run our two-man game on the one side, because most of the time when they switch off of me, I throw it in to Kev.

Or is it? Since Tanya told Portia to vamoose from her sight after Greg complained about the girl\u2019s presence, she\u2019s started hanging out with the Di Grasso family. And it seems Albie Di Grasso ( Adam DiMarco ) is clearly smitten with Portia. The two sweet twentysomethings have a nice Italian dinner together and share an incredibly awkward kiss goodnight. Albie is so afraid of being like his adulterous father (Michael Imperioli) that he politely asks Portia\u2019s permission to kiss her\u2026while she\u2019s venting about what she\u2019s learned about Tanya\u2019s traumatic past. Albie might be a chivalrous young man, but he still has a lot to learn about romance. While it remains unclear if Portia and Albie\u2019s budding romance will last, White Lotus stars Haley Lu Richardson and Adam DiMarco clearly have chemistry. The actors giggled and bantered like besties when Decider spoke with them about this new season of the HBO hit. Decider got the details on just how hard it is for Richardson to pretend she loathes working for Jennifer Coolidge\u2019s Tanya and how that first kiss was harder to nail than you\u2019d think\u2026 DECIDER: First of all Haley Lu, I want to say Portia does not like being Tanya\u2019s assistant. But, I\u2019m curious about how you felt about working with Jennifer Coolidge so closely, and if you have a favorite memory of working with her on the show? HALEY LU RICHARDSON: Well yeah, I mean, obviously it was hard for me because I was so excited to work with her, and I\u2019m also playing this character that\u2019s so not excited to work. So, it was really hard. Actually the very first day, the very first scene I filmed with her, I\u2019m pretty sure was the [Episode 3] scene with the fortune teller lady. In that scene, you know, Portia\u2019s having a rough day, rough time by that point. Actually, I think right from the get-go she\u2019s having a rough time. I just remember telling myself like, \u201cReally all I have to do today acting-wise is have all these reactions of being miserable and being annoyed, and being drained by this woman.\u201d But it was my first time working with Jennifer and watching her just like play and do these absurd things. It was really hard for me to not laugh. Like, it was really hard for me. I actually noticed in that scene, watching it, that like, every time they cut back to me, I have, like, a totally different expression on my face. Oftentimes I was like this [makes tense face] and I feel like I was doing that because I was trying not to smile. ADAM DIMARCO: I just watched that scene, it was great. RICHARDSON: You did? Did you notice me just like, going like this [makes the same face.] Adam, Albie is kind of painfully adorable and cute throughout the series. The scene where he wants to kiss Portia is so gentlemanly and chivalrous, but at some point it feels like that quality he has might be hurting him more than it\u2019s helping him. How did you sort of balance that, and where do you think it\u2019s coming from? DIMARCO: That was, I think, our first day working together which is pretty funny. RICHARDSON: That was! That was our first day. DIMARCO: Yeah, I mean Haley was laughing at me. Every time. RICHARDSON: It was hard. Every time he leaned in. [makes a smoochy face] It was so hard to not laugh. DIMARCO: Yeah, he is pretty adorable in that way, sweet and innocent in that way. But also, I mean, in that scene your character\u2019s talking about something pretty serious, right? With her boss, and like, I\u2019m trying to remember exactly. RICHARDSON: Yeah, I was saying how [Tanya] might\u2019ve been raped. DIMARCO: You said that? RICHARDSON: By her dad. DIMARCO: Yeah, see? And then, Albie\u2019s just thinking about the kiss which is like, innocent, but you should also be more\u2026You should be more emotional. RICHARDSON: Read the room. DIMARCO: Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s definitely fun to play with those like, levels of his\u2026you know, because he is a nice guy and he definitely is a feminist. But, he\u2019s battling with that internal wanting to smooch because kissing is fun. RICHARDSON: Albie loves to smooch. Haley Lu, your character wears a lot of knitwear and crochet, and I understand that you crochet. I was curious, because I crochet, did you crochet any of the pieces, did you have any input in that, how was it? RICHARDSON: I love this question! I love crocheting, it\u2019s my favorite thing! Oh yay, I\u2019m so excited. Yes. There is a hat there I wear in one of the episodes, like a little crocheted beige-white bucket hat, that I crocheted. That is the only thing I wear that I made. But, this is something I like to do. Whenever I can throw like an easter egg of something that I\u2019ve made on my character, or make my character a crocheter. Which, I don\u2019t think Portia would have the patience to do honestly. DIMARCO: Portia bought it from your Etsy page. RICHARDSON: My Etsy shop! Yeah, Portia shops at Hooked By Haley Lu. But, yeah I\u2019m always kind of partial to like, knit things and crocheted things because, you know, I love it. I\u2019m so glad you do it too, yay crocheters! DIMARCO: You kind of got me into it a bit more too. RICHARDSON: I did? Do you crochet? DIMARCO: It\u2019s cool, yeah. I don\u2019t crochet, but I\u2019m a fan.

You, the face staring at these words right now, the brain digesting the knowledge that your vote may finally count for something , may finally lead to changes in our lives for the better, once and for all. My fellow New Yorkers, I am writing this piece to let you know it is your votes that will ensure Lee Zeldin becomes the 58th governor of our once-great state. You have read The Post for months now, maybe years, and time and again its pages are filled with the frequent \u00adfulfillment of our worst fears. The crime, the corruption, the skyrocketing cost of living and, above all, the incompetent and reckless stewardship of our state government. The unchecked power of the Democratic Party has eroded our quality of life and transformed the Empire State into the Vampire State, sucking the lifeblood from its citizens and forcing countless numbers of our friends and coworkers to flee for greener pastures. Tuesday is the one opportunity you have left to say, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d; to say no; nyet; no m\u00e1s; non; laa; b\u00f9 sh\u00ec or nahin. It\u2019s time to tell Kathy Hochul that New Yorkers have been pushed around by the far-left woke mob for too long. The race is tightening. Recent polls show a massive shift of momentum toward not just Zeldin but a broad slate of moderate Republican candidates across the state . Victory is within reach , and yet victory, in and of itself, is not the end goal for Lee. He wants to save our state, restore balance to our government and deliver safe communities where everyone can thrive. That will not happen unless you act. If you are reading this in a bodega, waiting for your breakfast, concerned about the crime that has recently plagued your neighborhood, know that it has been Gov. Hochul and the Democrats who have long prioritized the well-being of criminals over the safety of the decent people you know. Vote to change that. If you are sitting in your taxi or Uber, the vehicle whose daily miles put food on your table, concerned about how Hochul\u2019s congestion pricing charge will harm your family, you must vote for Lee Zeldin to stop it. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority wastes $30 million building a staircase while allowing farebeaters to roam free on trains and buses, and yet Gov. Hochul thinks your bank account should be the one to pay for the agency\u2019s waste and mismanagement. Say \u201cNo\u201d on Tuesday. If you\u2019re reading this on the subway, glancing occasionally over the top of the page or your phone to keep an eye out for danger, fearful that you could be another victim of this year\u2019s 42% rise in transit crime, while Democrats ignore your concerns and call you a conspiracy theorist for feeling anxiety, vote Tuesday! No, I am not saying Lee Zeldin will end all crime; nor will he alleviate all your fears. But for once, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a governor who acknowledges our problems and doesn\u2019t bend to the pro-criminal left ? Recall, the governor has signed woke laws like \u201cLess Is More,\u201d literally touting the idea that \u201cless\u201d jail time for hardened criminals is somehow \u201cmore\u201d beneficial to society. Won\u2019t it be a blessing to have common sense back in the governor\u2019s mansion? If you are reading this at home, wondering how you\u2019ll pay this winter\u2019s massive electric and gas bills, remember that only the Democratic Party has shut down our power plants, banned energy extraction and repeatedly added taxes and fees to our bills. What is \u201cclimate justice\u201d anyway, when the harm falls on our poor and middle class? Vote Tuesday! If your small business was shut down, your house of worship closed, your child kept out of school, your job taken away or you were just forced to follow irrational mandates while people sitting home in their pajamas snickered at you: Take your resentment to the polls . If you\u2019re a law-enforcement officer, your family can\u2019t possibly justify staying home Tuesday. Vote. If you\u2019re worried about your children\u2019s education or worried how you will continue to afford groceries in New York. You must vote. If you have browsed the real-estate listings, plotting your family\u2019s departure from New York for a better situation elsewhere, make Tuesday your final stand to save your home. Lee Zeldin needs you to win and restore our state.

The Yankees or whichever team reaches agreement with Aaron Judge is going to have to make peace with that notion regarding the right fielder, as well. It\u2019s not just the production on the field in 2022, but the love-fest generated with the home crowd by both. Diaz\u2019s and Judge\u2019s 2022 performances feel like one-of-a-kind seasons. It will likely never be the same again for either, on or off the field. Hell, Judge got booed during the playoffs. So do you still want Diaz or Judge based on clear-eyed projections that accept the aging curve and what it means to have guaranteed riches well into the future? The Mets have answered affirmatively. They are in agreement with Diaz on a five-year, $102 million pact that will make him \u2014 by far \u2014 the owner of both the largest total contract ever bestowed upon a reliever and also the largest annual average value. Finalization of the deal was pending a physical. My sense when talking to Mets officials late in the season was that they would enter into a reunion understanding that the way Diaz performed in 2022 was arguably the best relief season in club history. Topping that at any point from 2023-27, the life of the contract, is not something general manager Billy Eppler would want to wager upon this week at the GM meetings \u2014 though it should be noted that Diaz had a season in the same vicinity for Seattle in 2018, which attracted the Mets to trade for him. Still, even if Diaz cannot duplicate his 2022 numbers, the Mets saw him as worth making a record wager upon. Of course, it helped that Steve Cohen personally likes this player and the Mets\u2019 owner has shown that what he likes he can afford to buy. And Sugar was likable. Diaz got off the canvas in New York, showing the mental toughness to graduate from relief pariah to bullpen messiah in a market particularly difficult for second acts. He was loved by his teammates. He was appreciated by manager Buck Showalter for his ability to take the ball regularly while avoiding drama by taking even low-in-the-order hitters seriously. He bonded well with pitching coach Jeremy Hefner, who seems to know the cues to keep Diaz\u2019s delivery from going askew. And there were the trumpets and the party environment that Diaz brought by simply entering a game. He was electric to the fans and a security blanket to this team. The Mets also had to face this reality: The only reliever who worked regularly for them in 2022 and was under control for 2023 was Drew Smith. So by getting on the board early with Diaz, the Mets know now who will be getting the final three outs as they try to assemble who will get the ball to him. Starters Chris Bassit, Jacob deGrom, Taijuan Walker and possibly Carlos Carrasco are free agents, as are setup men Tommy Hunter, Seth Lugo, Trevor May, Adam Ottavino, Joely Rodriguez and Trevor Williams. Keep in mind that Diaz is actually six months younger than Smith. He is receiving his deal after his age-28 season, just as Aroldis Chapman did from the Yankees following his 2016 campaign. That five-year, $86 million pact was the relief standard until now. That Chapman and Craig Kimbrel fell in performance on long-term deals as they approached their mid-30s is a worry; this contract, if Diaz does not use his option after the third season, will carry him through his age-33 season. But all long-term contracts are full of risk, even more so for relievers since performance so often vacillates and the full-bore nature of the job makes staying healthy trickier. But in reality, off the season Diaz had (a 1.31 ERA and striking out 50.2 percent of batters faced) he was going to top Chapman\u2019s total and the $18 million relief average record of Liam Hendriks. Were the Mets going to wait around to see if they could get him for, say $19 million per rather than the $20.4 million, when the difference over five years to Cohen is probably like a nickel or dime to you or me? Especially when the owner is obsessed with winning. Now. It is risky. But what was the cost (in dollars and potentially losses) of not bringing Diaz back to a bullpen already in full renovation? The Mets were willing to invest $102 million because they thought the price of the alternative was going to be way higher.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-19.3094539642334, -18.894588470458984]}, {"title": "Chris Pratt endorses billionaire Rick Caruso for LA mayor after seeing city's 'decline' into 'utter disarray'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chris-pratt-endorses-rick-caruso-la-mayor-watching-city-gradual-decline-utter-disarray", "description": "Chris Pratt endorsed Democrat Rick Caruso in his bid for Los Angeles mayor ahead of Tuesday's election.

Pratt, 43, took to Instagram stories where he virtually stumped for Caruso, a former president of the Los Angeles Police Commission . Caruso also served as a commissioner for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power under Mayor Tom Bradley in 1985. \"I've lived in LA for over 20 years. It's been great to me.

Bass is in her sixth term representing the 37th Congressional District following re-election in November 2020. Prior to serving in Congress, Bass represented the 47th district in the California State Assembly for six years. Bass and Caruso are running to replace termed-out mayor Eric Garcetti, but the hotly contested race has LA divided between the real estate developer (who is known for his hotspots including The Grove and The Commons in Calabasas) and former social worker who has advocated for Los Angeles communities for decades. Kim Kardashian threw her support behind Caruso in May, while Katy Perry tweeted her endorsement for Caruso the following month. Snoop Dogg, Elon Musk, Gwyneth Paltrow According to government records, Caruso was a Republican for over two decades before becoming an independent in 2011. Caruso changed back to Republican in 2016 \u2014 a year when he served as California campaign co-chair for Republican John Kasich\u2019s presidential bid \u2014 and then to independent again in 2019.

Times certainly have changed for the Jets (6-3). \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that Buffalo, we didn\u2019t have something for them,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWe wanted to prove something this week, and we did that.\u201d Garrett finished with 92 receiving yards, the third-highest total of his season .

The Bills steamrolled the Jets 45-17 last Nov. 14, and their offense had its way with the Jets\u2019 defense, dropped them to 2-7 at the time. Buffalo had 489 yards in total offense that day that included four rushing touchdowns. On Sunday at an electric, sold-out MetLife Stadium, the Jets beat the Bills 20-17 and they did it with a defense that\u2019s making a strong case as the best overall in the NFL. The Jets held the Bills prolific offense to 317 total yards, picked off quarterback Josh Allen twice and sacked him five times along the way. The most important statistic to come out of this Week 9 result is that the victory gave the Jets a 6-3 record and has them entering their bye week a mere half-game behind the Bills for first place in the AFC East. Laken Tomlinson, the Jets veteran starting left guard, was not with the team last season, but he knows what he sees with this team. \u201cI think our defense is the best in the league across the board,\u2019\u2019 Tomlinson told The Post. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys that can make plays across the defensive line and linebackers flying around and DBs, Sauce [Gardner] and D.J. [Reed], oh my God.\u201d Tomlinson came to the Jets after playing five seasons with San Francisco, including the 2019 season when the 49ers went to the Super Bowl on the wings of one of the best defenses in the league. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to say it, because I\u2019m superstitious, but I\u2019ve been a part of teams like that that have gone a far way in the league and I\u2019m having that same feeling right now,\u2019\u2019 Tomlinson said. The Jets made play after big play against the Bills. The biggest was the 19-yard strip-sack by defensive end Bryce Huff that left Buffalo in a third-and-21 predicament from its own 14-yard line, down 20-17. \u201cBryce has been a terror for us in practice,\u2019\u2019 Jets left tackle Duane Brown said. \u201cHe has a lot of great tools to rush the passer and he put them on display there. That was a big-time play and it ended the game for us.\u2019\u2019 Incredibly, Huff was inactive for the first three games this season because the Jets are so deep on the defensive line. \u201cI know it took us a couple of weeks to get him out there,\u201d Jets head coach Robert Saleh said. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally dress 10 D-linemen in a football game. It\u2019s just a matter of me sitting with Joe [Douglas, the GM] and saying, \u2018Screw it, we\u2019re dressing 10,\u2019 because we had to get him on the football field. \u201cHe wins his one-on-ones. Being able to rush the passer is like gold. It\u2019s a premium commodity. It is something he does at an extremely high level.\u2019\u2019 Huff, who\u2019s very humble, had no complaints about his role or how long it took to get him in the game. \u201cComing into the season I knew we had an extremely talented room and a bunch of new guys, so I knew what I was getting into,\u2019\u2019 Huff said. \u201cMy mindset the whole time was working every week to get better during practice and being supportive of my guys playing in the game, keeping everyone in high spirits.\u2019\u2019 Huff, who played his college ball at Memphis, called the strip-sack \u201ctied for number one\u2019\u2019 as his all-time best play with a safety he caused against Ole Miss his senior year, but he added this was is \u201cbest play in the NFL for sure.\u2019\u2019 To date, it\u2019s one of the best plays of the season for a Jets defense that believes it\u2019s second to none in the league. \u201cAs long as we go out there and we play to our potential,\u2019\u2019 rookie defensive lineman Jermaine Johnson said, \u201cwe know things can be pretty scary for the other side.\u2019\u2019", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-28.992862701416016, -11.850848197937012]}, {"title": "Sharon Lokedi and Evans Chebet complete Kenyan double at New York City Marathon", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/sport/nyc-marathon-sharon-lokedi-evans-chebet-spt-intl/index.html", "description": "Kenya's Sharon Lokedi was a surprise winner of the women's New York City Marathon on Sunday, while Evans Chebet won the men's race to complete a Kenyan double.", "content": "Kenya\u2019s Sharon Lokedi was a surprise winner of the women\u2019s New York City Marathon on Sunday, while Evans Chebet won the men\u2019s race to complete a Kenyan double.

Sitting in a wheelchair, his right leg bandaged and elevated, Khan spoke from the Shaukat Khanum hospital, where he was admitted Thursday after he received bullet wounds in his right leg. Khan repeated his demand for an investigation into the shooting and the resignation of three powerful personalities in the government and the military whom he alleges were involved in staging the attack on him. Khan\u2019s march on the capital was suspended in Wazirabad, a district in eastern Punjab province, after a gunman opened fire, wounding him and killing one of his supporters. Thirteen others were hurt. He said the march would pick up again from Wazirabad. Khan was ousted from office in April in a no-confidence vote in parliament. He organized a march on Islamabad to pressure Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s government to hold early elections but Sharif says elections will take place as scheduled, in 2023. Khan led an initial protest march in May but it ended when supporters clashed with police in the capital. Khan\u2019s protest march, which started Oct. 28, was peaceful until Thursday\u2019s attack. The shooting has raised concerns about growing political instability in Pakistan, which has a history of political violence and assassinations. Khan said the march, to be resumed Tuesday, will take 10 to 15 days to reach Rawalpindi, where convoys from other parts of the country are expected to join the rally. He said he will keep in touch with the main march participants through a media link and will eventually lead the \u201csea of people\u2019\u201d toward Islamabad.

He didn\u2019t try to play hero ball \u2026 and was hailed by his offensive linemen as a hero anyway. Nate Herbig: \u201cHe\u2019s a stud. He\u2019s a stud. He\u2019s a stud, we just beat the Buffalo Bills, he\u2019s a stud!\u201d Laken Tomlinson: \u201cI\u2019m proud of that kid, man.

But when James Robinson and Michael Carter began gashing the Bills when it mattered \u2014 73 yards on a combined eight carries at the start \u2014 less was more from him behind his nasty, relentless offensive line. Wilson: \u201cYou play with what\u2019s going. They wanted it, they wanted to keep running the ball. You could see the big guys up front were getting after it.\u201d Tomlinson: \u201cThat\u2019s the best feeling in the world.\u201d Herbig: \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling in the world. It\u2019s the best feeling ever.\u201d Duane Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s an O-lineman\u2019s dream. They know we want to run the ball. Everyone knows we want to run the ball, and we\u2019re able to continue to move the chains. There\u2019s no better feeling than that.\u201d Cedric Ogbuehi: \u201cWe asked for it, and they gave it to us, and they put it on our back, and we answered.\u201d It was critical that Wilson answered following his three-interception nightmare against the Patriots. Everyone around him had his back \u2014 a fake punt on fourth-and-1 early in the third quarter at the NYJ 48 was successful, Stefon Diggs was shut out on three targets in the second half \u2014 and he had theirs. Four plays before Carter\u2019s 6-yard touchdown that would cut the Jets\u2019 deficit to 14-10, Wilson found C.J. Uzomah for 5 yards on fourth-and-1 at the Buffalo 32. \u201cHe kept his composure throughout the week and he kept his composure in the game,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cNothing\u2019s too big for him.

That capped a 13-play, 75-yard drive. The Seahawks extended their advantage to 24-14 midway through the fourth on another impressive drive.

But just like all season, the Cardinals were hurt by their own mistakes. They were called for 12 penalties and were plagued by dropped passes and botched snaps. The Seahawks led 10-7 at halftime. They went ahead early in the second quarter when Smith found DK Metcalf for a 4-yard touchdown. The Seahawks caught a break on the previous play when cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. dropped a potential interception. The Cardinals looked like they might score late in the first half, but Murray fumbled on a scramble when Seattle's Ryan Neal punched the ball out from behind. The Seahawks recovered.

That\u2019s all the time he needed to put together another classic game-winning drive that resulted in a much-needed Bucs victory over the Los Angeles Rams , 16-13, on Sunday afternoon. After forcing the Rams to punt yet again \u2013 Los Angeles couldn\u2019t get anything going after taking a 13-6 lead in the third quarter \u2013 Brady looked at the clock and knew what needed to be done. Fans have seen it before, but with the way the Buccaneers\u2019 offense has been reeling at this point in the season, there was likely some doubt from fans.

(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) Yet, Brady put on his hard hat and got to work. Six plays were needed to send Tampa Bay , with no timeouts left, down the field. Set up on their own 40-yard line, Brady found tight end Cade Otton first with a 28-yard strike to get into Rams\u2019 territory. Then, after a completion to Leonard Fournette, Brady found Scotty Miller on back-to-back plays to move up 21 more yards and get to the Rams\u2019 seven-yard line with time to get a couple plays off. Brady wasted no time trying for his old reliable target, Mike Evans. Though he didn\u2019t come up with the completion, Derion Kendrick was called for defensive pass interference, and now the Bucs were really in business. TOM BRADY TALKS BALANCING PERSONAL LIFE, FOOTBALL AMID BUCCANEERS STRUGGLES First-and-goal from the Rams\u2019 one-yard line, Brady found Otton for a 1-yard score, and Raymond James Stadium went wild as the Bucs scored the game-winning touchdown with just nine seconds left on the clock. It was Brady's 55th career game-winning drive. \"That was f---ing awesome,\" he said after the game. Brady not only notched another come-from-behind win with a classic game-winning drive, he also surpassed 100,000 passing yards for his career. He entered the game with 99,836, which was already the NFL\u2019s all-time record, and walked out with 100,116 after a 280-yard performance on 58 pass attempts. But this game wasn\u2019t one to remember for Brady and the Bucs until that moment. It was more of the same as the previous three games in which they struggled to get anything going, and when they did, penalties would ruin the positive momentum.

(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) The Rams, who are struggling on the offensive side of the ball as well, didn\u2019t come up with much. However, Cooper Kupp did score the only first-half touchdown by any team on a 69-yard catch-and-run from quarterback Matthew Stafford. Though he came into this game with an ankle injury, Kupp was his usual productive self, totaling 127 yards on eight receptions with his score. TOM BRADY WELCOMES \u2018UNFAMILIAR\u2019 ROAD AS BUCS DROP TO 3-5: \u2018LOSING SUCKS\u2019 But the Rams\u2019 run game was subpar \u2013 Darrell Henderson Jr. had 56 yards on 12 carries with L.A. totaling just 68 yards on the ground \u2013 and Stafford didn\u2019t have too much time to let plays develop. He finished with 165 yards on 13-for-27 while being sacked four times. The Bucs, though, had just 51 rushing yards as Leonard Fournette once again couldn\u2019t get anything going behind his O-line. He had just 19 yards on nine carries, though he caught five passes from Brady for 41 yards. Brady used nine different receivers in this one to do what was needed to get the win despite how sloppy it might have been. It was just another reminder of why Brady is considered the greatest of all time: even when he looks down and out, there\u2019s always time left for the 45-year-old to get it done.

The significant drop-off in energy from the first period to the second period, and the carryover into the final frame, allowed for Detroit to force overtime, where Dominik Kubalik scored 2:43 into the extra period while on the power play to hand the Rangers their second straight loss Sunday night at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers quickly lost their grip on the game early in the second period, when they lost their 2-0 lead in the first 10 minutes. Detroit started playing with energy and the Rangers didn\u2019t do much to counter it, which allowed for the visitors to push their way right back into the contest. As the home team went from being first on pucks to somewhat lagging behind the play, the game seemed to drag for the Rangers. Less than three minutes into the middle frame, Red Wings forward Matt Luff managed to get behind Braden Schneider and put a stick on a hard shot from Ben Chiarot to deflect the puck past Rangers goalie Jaroslav Halak. A slow and poorly executed change by Rangers forwards later in the second period led to the Red Wings pouring on three straight shots, the last of which from Pius Suter finally beating Halak to tie the game at two-all at 8:37. As a result, Rangers coach Gerard Gallant opted to turn his lineup \u2014 which was already without top-four defenseman Ryan Lindgren (upper-body injury) \u2014 upside down to start the third. In bumping Artemi Panarin up to the first line with Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko, Vincent Trocheck centered the second unit between usual bottom-sixers Jimmy Vesey and Sammy Blais. Alexis Lafreniere skated on the left wing of the third line with Filip Chytil and Barclay Goodrow, while Chris Kreider was demoted to the fourth line with Ryan Carpenter and Julien Gauthier. Additionally, Zac Jones took just one shift in the third period in an apparent benching. The Rangers can seemingly have the puck on a string against some teams. Detroit happens to be one of them, but that didn\u2019t last past the first period. The puck always seems to end up back on their sticks for prolonged periods of possession in the offensive zone, as was the case for much of the first period as the Blueshirts built a 2-0 lead. Kakko opened the scoring at 9:14 of the opening frame, picking up a loose puck in front of the Red Wings\u2019 net and firing a pinpointed wrist shot right over the glove of Detroit netminder Alex Nedeljkovic. When defenseman Chiarot was called for interference on Blais later in the period, the Rangers\u2019 top power-play unit was clicking especially well. As much as the Red Wings looked prepared for how the Blueshirts work the zone with the man-advantage, Panarin\u2019s no-look setup of Zibanejad\u2019s blazing one-timer at 16:56 looked like it could fool anyone.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-20.572790145874023, -1.0752876996994019]}, {"title": "CNN host jokes Americans will have to eat smaller portions this Thanksgiving due to inflation", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-host-jokes-americans-will-eat-smaller-portions-thanksgiving-due-inflation", "description": "CNN host Fredricka Whitfield quipped that Americans will have to reduce their portion sizes this Thanksgiving due to high inflation.", "content": "close Video CNN host jokes that high prices will make Americans reduce their portion sizes this Thanksgiving CNN host Fredricka Whitfield joked that high inflation will case Americans to consume less food this Thanksgiving during a segment on CNN Newsroom.

The Jets continued their improbable season with a dominating performance on defense (five sacks and two interceptions) and a bounce-back game by quarterback Zach Wilson, providing a loud statement to their many doubters. One year after a 4-13 finish, the Jets (6-3) are tied with the Miami Dolphins for second place in the AFC East, only a half-game behind the Bills (6-2). \"Everybody outside of this locker room didn't think we had a chance, but it's been the same story all season for us,\" tight end Tyler Conklin said. \"Everybody kind of thinks it's going to be the Same Old Jets, right? Last week was, 'Oh, the Same Old Jets.' ... Guess what? We're not the Same Old Jets.\" The Jets went off as a 10.5-point underdog, making them the biggest home underdog with a winning record since 2007. On cue, they fell behind, 14-3, on two touchdown runs by Bills quarterback Josh Allen. Their hopes were fading after a third-quarter fumble by Wilson in the red zone, ruining a potential scoring drive that was disrupted by an unusual delay. The game was stopped for 11 minutes because of a broken cable on CBS' sky cam, which caused it to sink close to field level. Asked what he was thinking during the delay, Jets coach Robert Saleh said, \"It only happens to the Jets.\" When play resumed, the Jets committed a false start. Then, two plays later, Wilson coughed it up on a sack by Von Miller. As it turned out, the sky cam fell on the Jets, but the sky didn't. Moments later, rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner made an interception at the Bills' 19, setting up Wilson's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back James Robinson to give the Jets a 17-14 lead. After the Bills tied it, the Jets turned to their ground game, rushing 10 out of 12 plays on an 86-yard drive that culminated with a 28-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein with 1:43 left in the fourth quarter. They finished with 174 rushing yards, including a 6-yard touchdown by Michael Carter. The defense, with a sack by defensive end Bryce Huff on the final possession, slammed the door for the win. \"I know a lot of people are going to be surprised, right?\" Saleh said. \"I don't think there's a person surprised in the locker room.\" The Jets have won three games after trailing by double digits, compared to 4-30 in the previous four seasons. Under Saleh, they're 5-14 in those situations after going 0-20 in two seasons under Adam Gase. \"We don't flinch,\" Saleh said. \"We're too young to flinch.\" So much of the pre-game focus was on the Bills' defense, ranked first in point allowed and second in yards allowed. The Jets took it personally, aiming to prove their defense is on the same level. They did. Rarely blitzing, they used their four-man rush to rattle Allen (18-for-34, 205 yards) into one of his worst games. Wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who had five catches for 93 yards in first half, was blanked in the final two quarters: No catches, three targets. \"If we're not No. 1, that's the goal is to be No. 1,\" defensive end John Franklin-Myers said of the Jets' defense. \"We're going to keep playing and keep dominating teams and, hopefully, it plays out.\" Perhaps the most encouraging development was Wilson (18-for-25, 154 yards), who set a career high for completion percentage (72%). He was under intense scrutiny after last week's three-interception disaster in a 22-17 loss to the New England Patriots, but he managed the game nicely and had only one turnover. \"I don't really care what anybody says,\" Wilson said. \"Of course, I've been dealing with (criticism) my whole life. But that's a huge team win.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-28.17567253112793, -11.235480308532715]}, {"title": "Brady first in NFL to reach 100K passing yards", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34967884/tom-brady-first-nfl-history-reach-100000-passing-yards?device=featurephone", "description": "Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady on Sunday became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 100,000 career passing yards.", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Needing 164 passing yards Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 100,000 career passing yards (combined regular season and postseason). Brady reached the milestone midway through the fourth quarter, with a 15-yard completion to running back Leonard Fournette that led to a 50-yard field goal by kicker Ryan Succop. Fans cheered as the Raymond James Stadium public address announcer recognized the achievement, although Brady did not look up when the video screen showed him on the sideline, staring down at his iPad as the Bucs trailed 13-9. Brady went on to engineer a game-winning drive, with the second-latest passing touchdown in regulation of his career leading the Bucs to a 16-13 victory. Brady passed Peyton Manning for the most winning drives since the 1970 merger with 55. Brady had said last week that the 100,000-yards milestone was just as much about the people around him as it was his own personal achievement. \"I think for me it's a credit to all the guys that I've played with, and who have blocked for me, who have caught passes,\" Brady said. \"I think I can't do s--- in this league without guys doing what they are amazing at, too.\" It was the latest addition in Brady's collection of NFL records that in recent years have come in particularly meaningful games. Last year, in Brady's Week 4 return to Foxborough, Massachusetts, where he led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowls in 20 seasons, he captured the NFL's passing yards record (regular season) in a 19-17 victory with a 28-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Evans. The record previously was held by Drew Brees at 80,358 yards. Then in the Bucs' Week 13 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills last season, he grabbed the NFL's all-time completions record that also had been held by Brees at 7,142, with a 20-yard completion to Evans in the second quarter. In overtime, Brady threw his 700th career touchdown pass to Breshad Perriman, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 700 career touchdown passes. \"They're great achievements, but for as much as people want to say, 'Oh, this is what Tom Brady did,' in my mind, this is what myself and all these other people who have contributed to my life have done as well,\" Brady said. Asked what he would have thought if someone had told him 23 years ago, as the 199th overall draft pick, that he would reach 100,000 passing yards, Brady said, \"I think everybody would have said we're crazy, including me.\" \"All these kinds of lifetime achievement awards, they're great to celebrate with everyone, and one day I'll look back and think that it was pretty cool, although my kids probably won't care at all,\" he joked. \"That's all right. It's a credit to all the people that I've played with.\" It's a record that might not fall for decades -- if ever -- even with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes already amassing 24,531 passing yards entering Week 9 of his sixth season and fifth as a starter, and Bills quarterback Josh Allen at 18,030 passing yards midway through his fifth NFL season heading into Sunday. The next closest active players are Indianapolis Colts quarterback Matt Ryan, who had 64,415 passing yards heading into Sunday's game but had been benched in favor of Sam Ehlinger, and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had 63,054 passing yards entering Sunday and will turn 39 in December.", "date": "2022-11-07", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-28.320106506347656, -14.88574504852295]}, {"title": "New York City man stabbed in the face while waiting on Bronx subway platform", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-man-stabbed-face-waiting-bronx-subway-platform", "description": "The NYPD arrested a 24-year-old suspect for allegedly stabbing a man in the face around 7:00 a.m. on Sunday while the victim waited on a Bronx subway platform.", "content": "close Video NYC attack victim slams city leaders on Dr. Phil, warns of 'more victims like me' Dr. Phil spoke with the victim of a devastating attack in a New York City subway station, sparking a conversation about holding political officials accountable.

The general managers meetings, which officially begin Tuesday in Las Vegas, will kick the Hot Stove League into gear, with executives from all 30 clubs beginning to talk trades, free agents and more. The winter meetings in December are generally more action-packed, but there are plenty of storylines and intrigue this week as MLB begins what should be another big offseason. Here\u2019s a look at a few: As of Sunday morning, teams were allowed to talk to free agents, but discussing contract terms and signing deals was not allowed until 5 p.m. Thursday. The main attractions in this year\u2019s class are Aaron Judge, Jacob deGrom, Justin Verlander, Carlos Correa and Trea Turner. Mets closer Edwin Diaz grabbed the first deal of the offseason Sunday when he agreed to return to Citi Field on a five-year, $102 million deal, pending a physical. That deal is a record for a reliever, beating Aroldis Chapman\u2019s five-year, $86 million contract that expired this year. The average annual value of $20.4 million is also a record, topping the $18 million per season Liam Hendriks got from the White Sox in 2021. But the crown jewel of free agency figures to be Judge, who turned down a seven-year, $213.5 million extension offer from the Yankees just before the start of the season and then broke the American League home run record. In addition to the Yankees, who still appear to be the favorites to sign him, Judge\u2019s suitors are expected to include his hometown Giants and the Dodgers, among others. The right fielder could be in line to break Mike Trout\u2019s position-player record for average annual value of $36 million. The top pitchers available skew toward the older side with deGrom and especially Verlander and Clayton Kershaw, though lefty Carlos Rodon is the top option on the younger side. Might the Angels\u2019 historic two-way star actually be up for grabs? That remains to be seen, but he will certainly be a popular topic of conversation as a potential trade target. Ohtani, who had a 2.33 ERA as a starting pitcher and crushed 34 home runs with a .875 OPS as a hitter, will be playing on a $30 million deal in 2023, his final season before free agency. The wild card in the equation is that Angels owner Arte Moreno is expected to sell the team in the near future. How that affects the Angels\u2019 willingness to make Ohtani available in a trade is to be determined, but there should be no lack of suitors if they decide to at least listen. The Yankees were one of the few teams that made a serious offer for Ohtani at the trade deadline, per The Post\u2019s Jon Heyman. The Mets, led by GM Billy Eppler, who played a key role in recruiting Ohtani when Eppler was the Angels\u2019 GM, could certainly use him as well. A year after the free-agent class was led by star shortstops, it will be more of the same. Correa, Turner, Xander Bogaerts and Dansby Swanson all figure to be in line for big paydays. One team unlikely to be involved in the sweepstakes, for a second straight year, is the Yankees. GM Brian Cashman said Friday that the Yankees will have a competition at the position, with top prospects Oswald Peraza and Anthony Volpe getting closer to being ready to knock Isiah Kiner-Falefa out of the starting role. It would seem like a no-brainer that a team that just won the World Series would have an easy decision to retain its GM and manager. But the Astros\u2019 situation is somehow not a done deal. Owner Jim Crane refused to commit to either GM James Click or manager Dusty Baker for 2023 during their postseason run. Crane told reporters Saturday night, in the midst of the Astros\u2019 celebration, that he would revisit decisions on Click and Baker on Monday, per the Houston Chronicle. Baker seems likelier to be back, while former Brewers president of baseball operations David Stearns could be a candidate to supplant Click. Thursday will mark the deadline for teams to extend qualifying offers to their own free agents. The qualifying offer \u2014 which is set at $19.65 million for 2023 \u2014 was nearly eliminated in the new collective bargaining agreement that was approved earlier this year, but it was tied to coming up with a format for an international draft, which MLB and the union could not agree on. So the qualifying offer lives on, meaning teams that offer it to players who later sign with another team will receive draft-pick compensation. Last year, 14 players were extended qualifying offers and only one, the Giants\u2019 Brandon Belt, accepted it.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "nypost", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-19.028841018676758, -18.0860595703125]}, {"title": "Joey Logano captures second NASCAR Cup title with season-finale victory at Phoenix", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/joey-logano-captures-second-nascar-cup-title-season-finale-victory-phoenix", "description": "Joey Logano started on the pole and finished in Victory Lane, wrapping up his second NASCAR Cup Series championship on Sunday holding off the rest of the field.", "content": "close Video Will Joey Logano be NASCAR Champion?

Gibbs both worked in the front office of Joe Gibbs Racing, and Coy Gibbs also raced for the team, according to NASCAR. The news of Coy Gibbs\u2019 death left the NASCAR world stunned on the day of the final race of the season. A moment of silence was held his memory before the start of the race. Ty Gibbs, who was slated to drive the No. 23 car in Sunday\u2019s NASCAR Cup Series Championship Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona, was replaced by driver Daniel Hemric just hours before the race, with his 23XI Racing team citing \u201ca family emergency\u201d as the cause.

So it\u2019s definitely shocking to see him put them up because it\u2019s his baby. NFL teams are precious, they\u2019re important.\u201d Durant added he believes there will be a lot of bidders as the franchise is \u201cone of the most lucrative teams in sports\u201d and that \u201ceverybody wants to be a part of the league.\u201d Commanders\u2019 wide receiver Terry McLaurin gave Durant his jersey before the Nets played the Wizards in Washington on Friday night. \u201cI know we\u2019ve had some losing seasons, but it\u2019s starting to come around for us,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI\u2019m excited as a fan.

A new study shows statins are much more effective.", "content": "Millions of Americans are prescribed statins to reduce the risk of heart disease, but many prefer to take supplements like fish oil, garlic and flaxseed. Peter Dazeley/Getty Images hide caption Millions of Americans are prescribed statins to reduce the risk of heart disease, but many prefer to take supplements like fish oil, garlic and flaxseed. If you were prescribed medicine to lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke, would you take it? Millions of Americans are prescribed statins such as Lipitor, Crestor or generic formulations to lower their cholesterol. But lots of people are hesitant to start the medication. Some people fret over potential side effects such as leg cramps, which may be - or may not be - linked to the drug. As an alternative, dietary supplements, often marketed to promote heart health, including fish oil and other omega-3 supplements (Omega-3's are essential fatty acids found in fish and flaxseed), are growing in popularity . So, which is most effective? Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic set out to answer this question by comparing statins to supplements in a clinical trial. They tracked the outcomes of 190 adults, ages 40 to 75. Some participants were given a 5 mg daily dose of rosuvastatin, a statin that is sold under the brand name Crestor for 28 days. Others were given supplements, including fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols or red yeast rice for the same period. The maker of Crestor, Astra Zeneca sponsored the study, but the researchers worked independently to design the study and run the statistical analysis. \"What we found was that rosuvastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by almost 38% and that was vastly superior to placebo and any of the six supplements studied in the trial,\" study author Luke Laffin, M.D. of the Cleveland Clinic's Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute told NPR. He says this level of reduction is enough to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The findings are published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \"Oftentimes these supplements are marketed as 'natural ways' to lower your cholesterol,\" says Laffin. But he says none of the dietary supplements demonstrated any significant decrease in LDL cholesterol compared with a placebo. LDL cholesterol is considered the 'bad cholesterol' because it can contribute to plaque build-up in the artery walls \u2013 which can narrow the arteries, and set the stage for heart attacks and strokes. \"Clearly, statins do what they're intended to do,\" the study's senior author Steve Nissen, M.D., a cardiologist and Chief Academic Officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic told NPR. By comparison, he says this research shows that supplements are not effective. \"They do not promote heart health. They do not improve levels of the bad cholesterol.\" Nissen says supplements can be expensive compared to statin medications. Depending on insurance, Nissen says people may pay less than $5.00 a month out-of-pocket for rosuvastatin. \"Statins are the most effective heart attack and stroke prevention drugs that we have really ever seen,\" says Michael Honigberg , MD, a cardiologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who is not affiliated with the new study. He says the new findings add to an already large body of evidence showing statins lower LDL cholesterol, and he's not surprised to see that the supplements were not as effective. However, he says, not everyone with a family history of heart disease or slightly elevated cholesterol should be on a statin. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association developed some prescription guidelines. Typically, if a person's LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) is 190 or higher, they're often advised to start a statin. Health care professionals use a risk calculator to estimate a person's risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. If the risk is high enough, based on factors including age, blood pressure and smoking status, then a statin may be recommended. Honingberg says for people who have slightly elevated cholesterol, but are not at high enough risk to be prescribed a statin, he recommends that they focus on diet and exercise, rather than buying supplements. \"I tell my patients to save their money and instead spend that money on eating heart healthy, high quality food.\" He points to studies that show heart-healthy diets, including Mediterranean diets which emphasize healthy fats, lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains and the DASH diet , significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. \"I think a formulation that we perhaps don't use enough is that food is medicine and is probably a more effective medicine than supplements,\" says Honingberg. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health, has also concluded, based on prior research, that omega-3 supplements do not reduce the risk of heart disease , but eating fish \u2013 which contains omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 is linked to a reduced risk. This suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are most beneficial as part of a healthy diet. And it's worth noting that the NIH review concludes that omega-3 supplements may help relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Omega 3's are also added to baby formulas to promote brain development. The NIH review also concludes that omega-3 supplements can lower triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood. But Dr. Honingberg says this may be recommended for a \"small subset of patients\" with very high triglyceride levels. As for people whose risk of heart disease is high enough to warrant a statin prescription, Dr. Honingberg says he spends a fair amount of time talking through concerns with patients. \"We talk about the excellent safety profile and the very, very low risk of side effects,\" he says. He describes the risk of serious side effects as \"vanishingly small.\" Sometimes patients stop taking a statin because they believe it's causing a certain side effect. But Honingberg points to a double-blind research study that showed when patients were given a placebo in place of a statin, patients reported feeling most of the same side effects. \"So the punch line of the trial is people blame statins for side effects the statins aren't really causing,\" he says.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "npr", "category": "health", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [0.6585463881492615, 15.960269927978516]}, {"title": "Jets use Bills\u2019 new stadium to troll rival on Twitter after upset win", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/06/jets-troll-bills-on-twitter-with-stadium-scoreboard-after-upset-win/", "description": "The Jets' Twitter account had some fun after Gang Green pulled a massive upset over the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills on Sunday.", "content": "The Jets\u2019 Twitter account had some fun after Gang Green pulled a massive upset over the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

Of eight games in the early Sunday window, six came down to the fourth quarter. The Detroit Lions held on to a one-score lead to hand the Green Bay Packers their fifth straight loss, the Minnesota Vikings came back from 10 down to beat the Washington Commanders, and the Los Angeles Chargers secured a win over the Atlanta Falcons with a last-minute field goal.

The New England Patriots and Cincinnati Bengals won convincingly over the Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers, respectively. The Cleveland Browns, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers are on a bye and will return to action in Week 10. Our NFL Nation reporters react with the biggest takeaways and lingering questions off this week's matchups and look ahead to what's next. Games are Sunday unless noted. Let's get to it. Jump to a matchup: PHI-HOU | BUF-NYJ | GB-DET IND-NE | MIA-CHI | MIN-WSH CAR-CIN | LAC-ATL | LV-JAX Cincinnati 42, Carolina 21 Bengals What to know: Yes, the Bengals completely housed the Panthers in a rout. But it didn't reveal anything new about a Cincinnati team that still has plenty of work to do in order to reach the postseason. The Bengals have looked exceptional in three wins against NFC South opponents. But in the AFC North, Cincinnati is 0-3. Finding a balance between both extremes will likely decide the Bengals' postseason fate. Is Joe Mixon back on track? Potentially. Coming into the game, Mixon had minus-54 rushing yards above expectation, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. He went plus-74 on Sunday, which is a great sign for someone who was under scrutiny in the week leading up to this game. -- Ben Baby Next game: at Steelers (Sunday, Nov. 20, 8:20 p.m. ET) Panthers What to know: It will be difficult for interim coach Steve Wilks to keep PJ Walker as the starting quarterback Thursday against the Falcons. Walker had two interceptions and only 9 yards passing before Wilks turned to Baker Mayfield for the second half. The Panthers are expected to activate Sam Darnold from injured reserve Tuesday. They want to see what Darnold can do but likely won't have time to get him ready on a short week. Before today, one option after next week was to release Mayfield and go with Walker and Darnold the rest of the season. Walker's poor performance and the professionalism Mayfield has shown as the backup puts all options back on the table. Has the defense finally reached its limit? Carolina's one constant all season has been the defense that played reasonably well in all but one game. That went out the window in the first half when Bengals RB Joe Mixon became the first player to record 150 yards and four rushing touchdowns in a half since Seattle's Shaun Alexander in 2002. Carolina had given up only seven rushing touchdowns all season. So has this unit given up? Bad gap control is not a good sign. On top of the porous run defense, there were four penalties called for lining up offside. None of this is a good sign for Wilks, a defense coach, who is fighting for a shot at the full-time job. -- David Newton Next game: Falcons (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET) New England 26, Indianapolis 3 Patriots What to know: Defense and special teams lead the way. Matthew Judon and Josh Uche had three sacks apiece -- marking just the second time in franchise history that multiple players totaled three or more sacks in a game (Andre Tippett, Don Blackmon in 1985) -- and a blocked punt by Jonathan Jones set up a short touchdown for the offense. After totaling nine sacks, the Patriots head into their bye week at 5-4. It's hard to imagine them having the offensive firepower to keep up with Buffalo (and maybe even Miami), but they've at least kept themselves in the hunt. How much hope is there for the Mac Jones-led passing offense? Mac Jones finished 20-of-30 for 147 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions, as the offense struggled to find a rhythm throughout. While the Colts have given opposing QBs some problems this year, it's also fair to wonder why Jones & Co. haven't sustained more momentum. Shaky play along the offensive line has been hard to miss in recent weeks, and perhaps the return of starting center David Andrews -- who missed two games with a concussion -- after the bye will solidify some things, as first-round pick Cole Strange has struggled at left guard in his absence. -- Mike Reiss Next game: vs. Jets (Sunday, Nov. 20, 1 p.m. ET) Colts What to know: The Colts had the worst single-game offensive production in coach Frank Reich's five seasons, finishing with 121 total yards, and are now 0-2 with quarterback Sam Ehlinger under center. The Colts made the change to Ehlinger entering their Week 8 game against Washington, but through two weeks, they do not have a passing touchdown. n Sunday in Foxborough, the bottom fell out of their entire offense. The Colts' offensive line was in shambles, with the Patriots racking up nine sacks -- the most allowed by the Colts in a game since 2017. The quarterback change and the firing of offensive coordinator Marcus Brady haven't changed a thing in Indy. What should we make of the Colts' defense? The unit is playing extremely well, but it doesn't even matter. The Patriots had a season low in offensive yardage Sunday, but the defense cannot account for the lack of production by the Indianapolis offense. The Colts' defense entered the game ranking in the top 10 in scoring defense and total yards, but that has been consistently overshadowed by the offense's inability to score. The Colts' offensive struggles are a difficult reality to accept for defensive veterans like DeForest Buckner and Stephon Gilmore, who are having good seasons but have nothing to show for it. -- Stephen Holder Next game: at Raiders (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) Detroit 15, Green Bay 9 Lions What to know: The Lions traded tight end T.J. Hockenson on Tuesday to divisional rival Minnesota, but in his absence quarterback Jared Goff threw two touchdown passes to his replacements, Shane Zylstra and James Mitchell, in the second and fourth quarters. Detroit's offense had been shut out in the second half of every game since Week 4 vs. Seattle, but that changed in Sunday's victory against Green Bay. Did defensive backs coach Aubrey Pleasant's firing motivate the defense? Yes. Entering the Green Bay game, Detroit's defense was allowing the most points per game, which led to Pleasant's dismissal earlier in the week. Members of the secondary shouldered the blame for the Lions' decision then responded with a strong performance, which included two interceptions from rookie safety Kerby Joseph. Entering the day, the Lions had two picks all season. They had three against the Packers. -- Eric Woodyard Next game: at Bears (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Packers What to know: Aaron Rodgers looked a lot like Brett Favre, throwing willy-nilly and getting picked off three times as a result, and the rest of the Packers looked unrecognizable -- at least when using the last three seasons as the baseline. Two of Rodgers' interceptions came from inside the red zone and a third from just outside the 20, and it marked his first game with three picks since 2017. He's had five career three-interception games in his career, and none of the first four had come against an NFC North team. This time it came against a Lions team that had two interceptions all season coming into the game and had been allowing 32.1 points per game. As bad as things had been for the Packers in their four-game losing streak, losing a fifth in a row to the one-win Lions raises things to a whole other level. How many more games can you realistically expect the Packers to win? Their next three opponents -- the Cowboys, Titans and Eagles -- entered Sunday with a combined record of 19-4. They don't play a team currently with a losing record until Dec. 4 at Chicago, which is currently 3-5. And they still have games against the Rams, Dolphins and Vikings (who already beat the Packers in Week 1) before they wrap up the regular season with the Lions at home. -- Rob Demovsky Next game: vs. Cowboys (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) Miami 35, Chicago 32 Dolphins What to know: The Dolphins were not a pass-rusher away from fixing their defense, at least Sunday, and Bradley Chubb, while promising in his first start after being acquired in a trade, is not a one-man savior. Bears quarterback Justin Fields did essentially anything he wanted to, running for 178 yards and scoring four total touchdowns. While Fields' skill set makes this defensive performance seem like an outlier, the poor tackling has been there all season. How sustainable is this shootout model? It worked against the Lions. It worked against the Ravens. But the Bears pushed the Dolphins to the brink in a shootout few people saw coming. Miami's defense has forced its offense to play nearly perfectly to make up for its shortcomings, and that doesn't feel like a Super Bowl-winning formula. If the Dolphins' offense isn't clicking, there's little reason to believe their defense could stop an elite team. Their defense came up with a pair of big stops late in the fourth quarter Sunday (with the aid of a questionable no-call on Chicago's final drive), but how many more times the Dolphins can get away with this? -- Marcel Louis-Jacques Next game: vs. Browns (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Bears What to know: The Bears' offense has evolved into a high-powered unit over the past three weeks, and a big reason is Justin Fields' running. His 178 rushing yards Sunday, including a 61-yard touchdown scramble, were the most by a quarterback in a regular-season game in NFL history. Fields is also the first player in NFL history to throw three touchdown passes and rush for at least 150 yards in the same game. Creative playcalling resulted in Darnell Mooney's first touchdown of the season and two TDs for Cole Kmet, who is finally developing into a red zone threat. What adjustments will the Bears make to aid their pass rush? Chicago's biggest problem with its pass rush is not a personnel issue. The Bears' defensive philosophy is rooted in getting pressure with a standard pass rush -- they rank 16th with a 24.3% pressure rate when rushing four -- and it has become predictable for opponents to attack. Chicago allowed Tua Tagovailoa to complete 70% of his passes for 171 yards and two touchdowns against standard pressure. His other passing touchdown came when the Bears rushed three. The Bears inexplicably did not blitz Tagovailoa in the first half and sent extra rushers on only four of his 30 dropbacks. -- Courtney Cronin Next game: vs. Lions (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Minnesota 20, Washington 17 Vikings What to know: The Vikings might have won the NFC North on Sunday. Not literally, of course, but in improving their record to 7-1 on a day the Packers and Bears lost, the Vikings have built a five-game lead in the loss column in the division. Sunday's victory over the Commanders was the fourth game the Vikings have overcome a fourth-quarter deficit to win. They have been walking a tightrope all season, but that tightrope is leading them straight to a division title. Is there anything more the Vikings could have asked from new tight end T.J. Hockenson? Nope! After three days of practice with the team, Hockenson had by far the best game for a Vikings tight end this season. He was targeted a game-high nine times, catching all nine for 70 yards. He wasn't always elusive in the tight end screen game, but his first catch -- a 19-yard pass over the middle -- was the longest by a Vikings tight end this season. If nothing else, this game proved how much the Vikings wanted and needed a tight end of Hockenson's skill set. -- Kevin Seifert Next game: at Bills (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Commanders What to know: Washington's win streak ended because it continued to hurt itself at the worst moments. Doing so has cost the Commanders in multiple losses this season. The defense, which played well for three quarters, gave up crucial third-down conversions on a field goal drive -- a pass interference and a 47-yard gain -- and then Taylor Heinicke floated a high pass over the middle that was intercepted and led to the tying score. There also was an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty by John Ridgeway on a go-ahead field goal that allowed Minnesota to keep the ball and run 100 more seconds. Penalties and opponents' big plays have led to too many losses, and on Sunday they led to Washington losing a highly winnable home game. How long will they stick with Heinicke? The players and coaches all say the same thing: There's something about Heinicke. He has that \"it\" factor. But when it goes bad, it doesn't look good -- he was 15-for-28 for 149 yards on Sunday -- and leads to questions about how long they can stick with him once Carson Wentz returns (in two weeks, at the earliest). Although Heinicke authors some magical and fun moments, he also flirts with disaster. This time, it led to a fourth-quarter interception that set up tying touchdown. Still, if the Commanders win at Philadelphia next week, there's a good chance they'd keep rolling with Heinicke. -- John Keim Next game: at Eagles (Monday, Nov. 14, 8:15 p.m. ET) L.A. Chargers 20, Atlanta 17 Chargers What to know: The Chargers needed a game-winning 37-yard field goal from rookie Cameron Dicker to earn a 20-17 win over the Falcons and improve to 5-3. With the win, the Bolts remain in the hunt for their second playoff berth in nine seasons, but their schedule becomes much more difficult in the second half of the season. The Chargers' strength of schedule in games played so far ranks 30th in the NFL, according to ESPN analytics, and their strength of schedule remaining ranks 10th. When will the Chargers' plethora of injured players return? The Chargers have continued to pin their playoff run hopes on the return of several injured players, including wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, edge rusher Joey Bosa and kicker Dustin Hopkins. However, more names were added to the list Sunday, as defensive lineman Austin Johnson left the game because of a right knee injury and right tackle Trey Pipkins III was sidelined because of a left knee injury. There is no clear timeline for their returns. -- Lindsey Thiry Next game: at 49ers (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET) Falcons What to know: It's the barrier the Atlanta Falcons can't seem to break. Thirteen times since the start of the 2018 season, the Falcons have been at .500. Thirteen times, Atlanta has lost its next game - including a 20-17 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, continuing the longest stretch at .500 or below (74 games) in the NFL. The last time the Falcons were over .500 was also their last playoff appearance: 2017. In a season in which there has been a lot of progress and surprising success, a winning record still eludes Atlanta. Is this what to expect from the Falcons' running game going forward? Cordarrelle Patterson's return to the starting role was going to result in alterations to Atlanta's top-five running game, all for the better. And that showed as the Falcons once again rushed for over 200 yards. But the breakdown of carries -- almost a 50-50 split for Patterson and Tyler Allgeier, with some work for Caleb Huntley -- makes it hard to predict how the rest of the season will go. The Falcons are clearly going to be smart with Patterson and will continue to move him around the formation, which could keep him from taking on a massive workload similar to what he saw before his knee injury. The emergence of Allgeier -- who looked very good Sunday with 99 yards -- and Huntley in Patterson's absence probably means Patterson will still get a good amount of work in typical game situations, with Allgeier and Huntley playing more in four-minute scenarios, but all three getting some carries each week. -- Michael Rothstein Next game: at Panthers (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET) N.Y. Jets 20, Buffalo 17 Jets What to know: The biggest win of the Robert Saleh era was highlighted by QB Zach Wilson's best performance of the season. Under intense pressure after last week's three-interception disaster, Wilson set a career high for completion percentage (72%), eliminated the careless decisions that caused so much harm last week and orchestrated a long field goal drive to win it. He had one turnover (strip sack) but managed the game nicely. This was exactly what he and the Jets needed. It showed the Jets can be a playoff team if they stick to their formula -- run the ball (174 yards vs. Bills), play great defense and play virtually mistake-free at quarterback. Do the Jets have one of the best defenses in the NFL? Absolutely. The Jets, ranked sixth in yards allowed at the start of the day, outplayed the vaunted Buffalo defense. They intercepted Josh Allen twice and sacked him five times in a season-defining performance. They did it with a four-man rush, rarely blitzing. Their deep coverage was excellent. Receiver Stefon Diggs, who caught a 42-yard pass on the game's first play, was held without a reception in the second half. Rookie Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed were outstanding at cornerback. -- Rich Cimini Next game: at Patriots (Sunday, Nov. 20, 1 p.m. ET) Bills What to know: Josh Allen played his worst game of the season, finishing 18-of-34 for 205 yards with two interceptions -- and it could have been three interceptions but the Jets missed an opportunity in the fourth quarter. The quarterback looked out of sync with his receivers, and the offense was unable to consistently put together drives or capitalize on most of the longer drives they did have. Allen's two rushing touchdowns established an early lead, but the offense couldn't build on them. One sign of the Bills' offensive woes? Receiver Stefon Diggs didn't have a second-half reception -- only the second time he has gone without a catch in a half in the past two years. Is the Bills' run defense a major concern now? Yes. The Bills were missing key players on defense -- linebacker Matt Milano and safety Jordan Poyer -- but that's not an excuse for how the run defense has struggled for a second straight game. Even when it was clear the Jets would run the football on the final drive of the fourth quarter, they continued to pick up significant gains. The Bills have allowed the two highest rushing totals of the season in the past two games (208 yards vs. Packers; 175 vs. Jets). -- Alaina Getzenberg Next game: vs. Vikings (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Jacksonville 27, Las Vegas 20 Jaguars What to know: This come-from-behind victory could be a turning point for a team that is still trying to figure out how to play a complete game. The Jaguars were either tied or had a lead in the fourth quarter in five of their six losses but couldn't close the deal. Rallying from a 17-0 first-half deficit and finally making a defensive stand in the fourth quarter -- after missing a field goal that would have given them a seven-point lead -- will be a huge confidence boost for the Jaguars' in their next two games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. When is QB Trevor Lawrence going to play consistent football? Lawrence played one of his best games of the season one week after playing one of his worst, which included throwing another interception in the end zone. Coach Doug Pederson has said he's going to make Lawrence work through the ups and downs of his struggles. Giving Lawrence quick throws to get him in a rhythm helps, but Pederson said Year 2 in his system will make a big difference. -- Mike DiRocco Next game: at Chiefs (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET) Raiders What to know: Good things happen for the Raiders' offense when wide receiver Davante Adams is targeted early and often. Adams, who had one catch for 3 yards in a shutout loss at New Orleans last week, announced his presence with authority early in Jacksonville. Adams, who was dealing with an illness the previous week, made the Jaguars' secondary pay with a season-high 143 receiving yards -- on nine catches -- and 2 TDs before halftime. No wonder the Raiders jumped to a 17-0 lead with 10:51 to play in the second quarter. So why didn't the Raiders ride Adams in the second half? Between taking that 17-0 lead and trailing 27-20, Adams had one catch, on eight targets, for 3 yards. It's mystifying how fast the Raiders went away from the hot hand, no matter what kind of exotic defenses were thrown at Adams. Because if he's doubled, tripled and/or bracketed, someone else is open. Plus, the inevitable defensive collapse didn't help, as it was the third time the Raiders, who fell to 2-6, blew such a lead (20-0 to Arizona and 17-0 at Kansas City). Yet all six Raiders losses are by just one possession. -- Paul Gutierrez Next game: vs. Colts (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) Thursday Philadelphia 29, Houston 17 Eagles What to know: Jalen Hurts' return home proved to be a historic night, as he helped guide the Eagles to their first 8-0 start with an ugly-early, good-enough-late win over the Texans. Hurts referred to this as a \"business trip,\" but those close to him knew the return to Houston held special meaning. It wasn't always pretty, but he rose to the moment, tossing a pair of touchdown passes -- including a go-ahead 17-yard strike to A.J. Brown in the third quarter -- to keep the undefeated train rolling. How much will DT Jordan Davis' absence hurt them? The Eagles' first game without Davis, who was just placed on injured reserve with a right high ankle sprain, proved problematic for the rush defense. Houston's Dameon Pierce went off for over 100 yards on 27 carries despite being the defense's primary focus all week. Davis has been a difference-maker. Entering the game, the Eagles allowed 3.9 yards per rush with him on the field (70 rushes) versus 6 yards per rush with him off the field (112 rushes). -- Tim McManus Next game: vs. Commanders (Monday, Nov. 14, 8:15 p.m. ET) Texans What to know: Welcome back, Dameon Pierce. Last week the rookie running back struggled against the Titans and finished with 35 yards, his second-lowest of the season. But against the undefeated Eagles, he bounced back with a huge performance that gave the Texans a chance to win as they trailed 21-17 going into the fourth. He finished with 139 yards rushing and produced a highlight run of 36 yards that featured defenders bouncing off of him in the second quarter. The Texans' offense goes as Pierce goes, if he's rolling, the Texans' offense has a chance. When he's not, the offense struggles to score -- like it did in Week 8 when Houston posted 10 points. What's up with WR Brandin Cooks? Cooks didn't play Thursday night due to personal reasons after not being traded at the deadline. Cooks was unhappy with the fact that he wasn't traded. The Texans couldn't find a deal that worked for them, as teams didn't want to take on his guaranteed $18 million salary for 2023. Cooks is the Texans' leading receiver with 354 yards and 32 receptions. But he's in the middle of a subpar season by his standards, currently averaging 50.6 yards per game, the second-lowest per-game average of his career. -- DJ Bien-Aime Next game: at Giants (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-28.341442108154297, -8.224959373474121]}, {"title": "Arkansas Sen.

Marc Greenwod Opelika, AL The Issue: The alleged threats to democracy the president outlined in his speech at Union Station. I believe that President Biden and his woke radicals are largely responsible for the extremely harsh talk and even much of the violence found in American politics today (\u201c Prez\u2019s rail \u2018ghost\u2019ly site ,\u201d Nov. 3). Even though he now says it\u2019s time to tone down the rhetoric, the record shows he was and is an instigator. His suggestion during the 2012 election that the Republicans were going to put black Americans \u201cback in chains\u201d should never have been said. Now he is claiming, \u201cThe survival of our planet and democracy itself are on the ballot.\u201d That\u2019s why I believe he remains an instigator. Charles Winfield Princeton, NJ In his Union Station speech, Biden never mentioned Homeland Security\u2019s meetings with Facebook and Twitter. He also failed to mention the politicization of the investigation into Hunter\u2019s laptop, with FBI investigators deep-sixing the info. And he omitted the Justice Department\u2019s probe into parents objecting to school curricula at board meetings. Perhaps Biden is confused as to who and what represent real threats to our democracy. Here\u2019s hoping that the truth shall prevail and our country can be saved.

A woman ought to have the right to exercise in a public space without fear of grievous sexual assault . Instead, progressives were silent \u2014 but it\u2019s part of a pattern: They\u2019ve remained quiet as mice even as deadly attacks against women have soared this year. According to progressive orthodoxy, just to mention last week\u2019s rape, in which the perpetrator broke the victim\u2019s neck bones, is bad form. The New York Times has refused to even print a basic news story on the attack. State Sen. Brad Hoylman expressed more outrage about GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin showing up to the assault site than he did about the assault itself. The mostly male car-free-streets activists who fought for decades to get a pedestrian and bike path along the Hudson riverfront had nothing to say about the fact one of their pedestrian constituents just suffered a terrible trauma there. You see, to admit a problem would be to admit a solution . In this case, the alleged perpetrator is a lifelong criminal with 25 prior arrests . He\u2019s not mentally ill: Suspected of two previous similar attacks, he selected his victims at isolated times of day and planned his getaways. And rape is not a crime of economic desperation. This is just a bad guy, who, if guilty as charged, belongs in prison \u2014 and progressives just can\u2019t admit that. It\u2019s part of a dangerous new pattern of ignoring or minimizing crimes against women and girls \u2014 even fatal ones. In September, 17-year-old basketball prospect Shayma Roman was shot and killed in Brooklyn in front of her sister, by a gunman who fired a \u201cstray bullet.\u201d In June, 25-year-old Jelani Green, a would-be hairstylist, was shot in The Bronx while watching a basketball game, also by a stranger gunman, and died three months later of her injuries. In May, 11-year-old Kyhara Tay was similarly shot and killed by strangers on a Bronx sidewalk. In April, 16-year-old A-student Angellyh Yambo was shot and killed , also by strangers, outside her Bronx high school. And in the first quarter of 2022, New Yorkers Jennifer Ynoa, Kristal Bayron-Nieves, Michelle Go, Dorothy Clarke-Rozier, Gloria Ortiz and Christina Yuna Lee also lost their lives to random murderers unknown to them. That\u2019s 10 women or girls killed this year by total strangers \u2014 crimes that were once very rare events. In 2020 and 2021 combined, six women were killed by strangers; in 2019, \u201conly\u201d one woman was killed by a stranger. In 2018, no New York City woman died at the hands of a stranger. So if one is too many, 10 is really too many. Just like subway murders, which have soared from one or two annually through 2019 to nine this year, deadly random attacks on women, bad enough in themselves, are also symptoms of a bigger problem \u2014 a problem that people who walk around or take the trains can see, in the constant environment of greater hostility. Yes, some criminals are mentally ill \u2014 but many others are just emboldened by an environment of impunity. The alleged killers of Go, Lee, Ortiz, Bayron-Nieves, Ynoa and Tay all have criminal records; the alleged killers of Bayron-Nieves and Lee were out on no-bail release at the time of the murders. Yet you won\u2019t hear of this crisis from progressives. Gov. Kathy Hochul, Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and the rest haven\u2019t breathed a word about it at their recent rallies. They say: Crime is low (notwithstanding the inconvenient fact that New York\u2019s 105,287 felony total this year so far is 32% above 2019 year-to-date levels ). New York is safer than Oklahoma, or it\u2019s safer than it was in 1990, or something like that, the crime deniers say. Anyone who says otherwise is a conspiracist or a fearmonger . It\u2019s not just that women and girls have to deal with a different reality when walking, jogging, biking or taking the train, relative to 2019 \u2014 constantly budgeting their time so that they\u2019re not caught out alone too late after dark, for example, or switching routes to avoid walking along isolated passages. It\u2019s also that as we do that, we\u2019re constantly told that we\u2019re crazy or lying or both. Nope: As is often the case, the data back up what you intuitively feel.

Wilson led the Jets to a shocking 20-17 upset win over the Bills at MetLife Stadium a week after playing one of his worst games as a pro. Wilson had no interceptions in the game, played efficiently and used his legs to pull off the biggest win the Jets have had in years. The Jets defense intercepted Josh Allen twice and came up with some huge stops in the win over the high-powered Bills. Wilson completed 18 of 25 passing for 154 yards and one touchdown pass. He also ran the ball four times for 25 yards. His only negative was a fumble. The Jets go into their bye week an improbable 6-3. The Bills are now 6-2. The Jets rediscovered their running game down the stretch and leaned on it to go down the field on the game-winning drive. The Jets took over on their own 4 after stopping the Bills with 7:53 left to play. James Robinson and Michael Carter combined for eight rushes for 74 yards to move the ball down the field and then Wilson hit Denzel Mims on third-and-5 at the Bills 18-yard line for a 12-yard gain to the 6. The Jets failed to punch it into the end zone and had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein with 1:43 left in the game. Buffalo got one more chance, taking over at their own 25. Allen hit Stefon Diggs for a 26-yard pass on the first play but the play was wiped out by a holding call on Bills tackle Dion Dawkins. Bryce Huff then sacked Allen on second down and Allen fumbled the ball, losing 19 yards. On third-and-21, Allen threw an incomplete pass. On fourth down, Allen threw it deep to Gabe Davis, but Sauce Gardner had the coverage and the ball fell incomplete, sending MetLife into a celebration It looked like the Bills might blow the Jets out early. Punter Braden Mann slipped on the opening kickoff and the Bills got the ball at their own 45-yard line. On the first play from scrimmage, Allen hit Stefon Diggs for a 42-yard gain. Diggs beat Gardner on the play. The Bills got down to the Jets\u2019 13 but Allen threw his first interception of the game to Jordan Whitehead, ending the scoring hope. Buffalo got the ball back and this time they cashed in on Allen\u2019s legs. He led them on a 14-play, 67 yard drive that finished with a 1-yard Allen touchdown run that followed a 12-yard run by Allen that was first called a touchdown and then overruled and spotted at the 1. The Jets got on the board with 35 seconds left in the first guard when Zuerlein booted a 53-yard field goal to make it 7-3. In the middle of the second quarter, Allen led the Jets down the field on a drive that featured three passes to Diggs. Allen then ran through the Jets defense on third-and-2 for a 36-yard touchdown. Allen was not touched on the designed run as he went right around the Jets defense and scored his second touchdown of the game to put the Bills up 14-3. Wilson, who played efficiently all day, led a Jets scoring drive of his own at the end of the half. He connected with Carter for a 6-yard touchdown with 35 seconds left in the half to cut Buffalo\u2019s lead to 14-10. Bills kicker Tyler Bass missed a 55-yard field goal attempt as time expired in the half. The Jets went on a long drive to start the second half. The drive included a fake punt that was converted by Ashtyn Davis and a 12-minute delay due to a malfunction of the SkyCam in MetLife Stadium . The drive ended when Von Miller sacked Wilson and the Jets quarterback fumbled at the Bills\u2019 28. A.J. Epenesa recovered and ended the Jets\u2019 scoring hopes. The Bills stumbled themselves, though. Quinnen Williams sacked Allen on the first play of the series and then Allen was intercepted by Gardner on the second play. Four plays after Gardner\u2019s second interception of the season, Wilson hit Robinson for a 7-yard touchdown that gave the Jets their first lead of the day at 17-14. Bass tied the game up 17-17 with a 51-yard field goal with 13:38 to play in the game. The Jets defense did a great job all day against the high-powered Bills offense. D.J.

Salvatore Cavalli/AP hide caption The Norway-flagged Geo Barents rescue ship carrying nearly 600 migrants arrives at Catania's port in Sicily on Sunday. CATANIA, Sicily \u2014 The captain of a charity-run migrant rescue ship refused Italian orders to leave a Sicilian port Sunday after authorities refused to let 35 of the migrants on his ship disembark \u2014 part of directives by Italy's new far-right-led government targeting foreign-flagged rescue ships. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni's two-week-old government is refusing safe port to four ships operating in the central Mediterranean that have rescued migrants at sea in distress, some as many as 16 days ago, and is allowing only those identified as vulnerable to disembark. On Sunday, Italy ordered the Humanity 1 to vacate the port of Catania after disembarking 144 rescued migrants, including with children, more than 100 unaccompanied minors and people with medical emergencies. But its captain refused to comply \"until all survivors rescued from distress at sea have been disembarked,\" said SOS Humanity, the German charity that operates the ship. The vessel remained moored at the port with 35 migrants on board. Later Sunday, a second charity ship arrived in Catania, and the vetting process was being repeated with the 572 migrants aboard the Geo Barents ship operated by Doctors Without Borders. The selection was completed by late evening, with 357 allowed off but 215 people blocked on board. Families were the first to leave the ship. One man cradling a baby expressed his gratitude, saying \"Thank you, Geo Barents, thank you,\" as he left. Another man in a wheelchair was carried down by Red Cross workers. Yet two other boats run by non-governmental organizations remained stuck at sea with no port willing to accept the people they rescued. Humanitarian groups, human rights activists and two Italian lawmakers who traveled to Sicily protested the selection process as illegal and inhumane. Italy's new Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi is targeting non-governmental organizations, which Italy has long accused of encouraging people trafficking in the central Mediterranean Sea. The groups deny the claim. \"Free all the people, free them,'' Italian lawmaker Aboubakar Soumahoro said in an emotional appeal directed at Meloni from the Humanity 1 rescue ship. The passengers have faced \"trauma, they have faced everything that we can define as prolonged suffering,\" said Soumahoro, who spent the night on the ship. Later at the port, he accused Meloni of playing politics at the expense of \"newborns, of women, of people who have suffered traumas of all kinds,\" including torture in Libyan prisons. He said neither translators nor psychologists were on hand during Italy's selection process and many of the migrants were from Gambia, unable to speak French, English or Italian. \"Their fault is to speak another language. Their fault is to have another color,'' Soumahoro said, accusing the Italian government of using the migrants to distract from other issues, including high energy prices. Aboard the Humanity 1, doctors in Italy identified people needing urgent medical care after the ship's doctor refused to make a selection, said SOS Humanity spokesman Wasil Schauseil. Thirty-six people were declared non-vulnerable and were not permitted to disembark, prompting one to collapse and be taken away by an ambulance. \"You can imagine the condition of the people. It is very devastating,\u2033 he said. Both SOS Humanity and Doctors Without Borders issued statements declaring that all of their passengers were vulnerable after being rescued at sea, and deserving of a safe port under international law. SOS Humanity said it plans to file a civil case in Catania to ensure that all 35 survivors on board have access to formal asylum procedures on land. Doctors Without Borders emphasized that \"a rescue operation is considered complete only when all of the survivors have been disembarked in a safe place.\" Two other charity ships carrying rescued migrants remained stuck at sea, with people sleeping on floors and decks and spreading respiratory infections and scabies as food and medical supplies drew low. The German-run Rise Above, carrying 93 rescued at sea, sought a more protected position in the waters east of Sicily due to the weather, but spokeswoman Hermine Poschmann said Sunday that the crew had not received any communications from Italian authorities. Poschmann described cramped conditions on the relatively small 25-meter (82-foot) ship. The Ocean Viking, operated by the European charity SOS Mediteranee, with 234 migrants on board, remained in international waters, south of the Strait of Messina, and got no instructions to proceed to an Italian port, a spokesman said Sunday. Its first rescue was 16 days ago. \"Agitation is evident among the survivors,'' a charity worker named Morgane told The Associated Press on Sunday. Cases of seasickness were soaring after high waves tossed the ship through the night. \"Today, the weather considerably deteriorated, bringing strong winds, rough seas and rain on deck. ... these extreme conditions added suffering,\" she said. The confrontational stance taken by Meloni's government is reminiscent of the standoffs orchestrated by Matteo Salvini, now Meloni's infrastructure minister in charge of ports, during his brief 2018-2019 stint as interior minister. Italy's new government is insisting the countries whose flags the charity-run ships fly must take in the migrants. In a Facebook video, Salvini repeated his allegations that the presence of the humanitarian boats encourages smugglers. Nongovernmental organizations reject that claim, saying they are obligated by the law of the sea to rescue people in distress and that coastal nations are obligated to provide a safe port as soon as feasible. Amnesty International called Italy's stance \"disgraceful.\" \"Italy legitimately expects other EU member states to share responsibility for people seeking asylum, but this does not justify imposing measures that only increase the suffering of already traumatized people,\" the group said.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [7.3242268562316895, 1.2289401292800903]}, {"title": "Model who accused Adam Levine of flirting hosts lucrative strip club gig", "link": "https://pagesix.com/2022/11/06/model-accusing-adam-levine-of-flirting-hosts-lucrative-club-gig/", "description": "Far be from us to speculate about Alyson Rose's motivation for the revelation.

Facing the largest halftime deficit in team history, down 35-0 to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at Paycor Stadium, interim coach Steve Wilks finally turned to the first pick of the 2018 draft and benched a struggling PJ Walker. Mayfield, playing for the first time since a Week 5 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Tommy Tremble on his first drive to cut the lead to 35-7. He finished having completed 14 of 20 passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns, his first scores since a Week 4 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. It was only the fifth and sixth touchdown passes of the season for Mayfield against four interceptions. The Panthers ended up losing the game, 42-21. Mayfield was replaced by Walker in Week 6 after suffering a high ankle sprain in the loss to the 49ers. He remained the backup despite being healthy enough to play the next two games and Sunday against the Bengals. In part this was because Walker was playing well and in part because Mayfield's 15.3 Total Quarterback Rating the first five games was last in the NFL and the worst for a quarterback since ESPN began tracking the stat in 2006. Walker had a disastrous first half against the Bengals, completing only 3 of 10 pass attempts for 9 yards with two interceptions. The Panthers were outgained 268 yards to 19 in the half, and the 35-point deficit was the largest for a first half in team history. The previous record was a 32-point deficit to the New Orleans Saints on Dec. 29, 2019. Mayfield talked earlier in the week about the \"looming question'' of what his future would be at Carolina when 2021 starter Sam Darnold was activated from injured reserve with the Tuesday deadline coming up. That would leave the Panthers with three quarterbacks in Walker, Mayfield and Darnold, and teams seldom carry three quarterbacks with another on the practice squad. Wilks also has said previously he wanted to get another look at Darnold before the season is over. \"That's not for us to handle,'' Mayfield said Thursday. \"We're worried about one day at a time.

After an exciting Sunday of action, we have one more opportunity to wager on professional football. So which plays do our analysts like the most? Betting analysts Joe Fortenbaugh and Anita Marks , fantasy and sports betting analyst Andr\u00e9 Snellings , plus Football Outsiders' Aaron Schatz provide their top plays. Note: Lines from Caesars Sportsbook unless otherwise indicated. Baltimore Ravens (-2, 47) at New Orleans Saints Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET, Caesars Superdome The Ravens enter Monday night's matchup against the Saints as only 2-point favorites. Do you like the Ravens to keep their NFC South streak rolling or can the Saints pull off the upset? Schatz: I'll take the Ravens and give the two points. Baltimore is still ranked fourth in the league in DVOA, including No. 2 on offense and No. 1 on special teams. Of course, you have to discount their offense a bit with both Mark Andrews and Rashod Bateman out (although Bateman hasn't played a big role for weeks), but you also need to consider the New Orleans defense without cornerback Marshon Lattimore. As I've noted multiple times in this space, Baltimore's poor performance in the fourth quarter early in the year is not an indication that we should expect fourth-quarter collapses all season long. The Ravens are the better team and should pull this out, even if the Saints get frisky. Marks: I like both the Ravens and the over . The Ravens will be without a few offensive weapons, but they still have the quarterback who stirs the drink under center. Kenyan Drake and Isaiah Likely will have to step up on Monday. I like the addition of Roquan Smith, which should help the Ravens defense to slow down an Andy Dalton-led offense. Also, Brad Rogers' crew will be officiating, which means more penalties than average. That plays to the over. Cash out your parlay too early? Get burned on a last-second play? Come commiserate with Jason Fitz and his bad beats of the week. Lamar Jackson has averaged 69.1 rushing yards per game and currently leads the league in yards per carry (7.4). The Saints' defense has also had some success against mobile quarterbacks, limiting them to just 136 yards and two touchdowns on 31 attempts. Jackson's rushing yard prop is currently 62.5 and he is +145 to score a touchdown. What are your thoughts? Schatz: I like the under on the Jackson rushing prop, but would avoid the TD prop. We currently have Jackson projected with just 0.28 rushing touchdowns, closer to a line of +250. Beyond that, the Saints rank 31st in pass-rush win rate, suggesting there will be less pressure on Jackson to get out of the pocket and scramble. For the Saints, one of the lone bright spots this season has been the resurgence of Alvin Kamara. New Orleans is one of the best rushing teams in the league (fourth in rushing yards), while Baltimore has one of the best run defenses and just added a star linebacker at the trade deadline. Do you like Kamara to go over his rushing prop (60.5 yards) on Monday night? Snellings: I like Kamara to go over 97 total yards, but I'm agnostic on his rushing prop. Kamara has always been best when being used as a dual threat, and he's continued that during his resurgence. Over his past four outings, he has averaged 78.3 rushing yards and 67.0 receiving yards for 145.3 yards/game total, going over 100 yards in all four games. He's had more receiving yards than rushing yards in two straight games, making total yards the safer play than simply counting on rushing alone. What is your best bet for Monday night's game? Fortenbaugh: I'm going with Baltimore -0.5 (-105) in the first half. The Ravens rank fifth in the NFL in opponent first-half points per game (8.8) and just added a star linebacker (Smith) in a trade with Chicago. Through eight weeks, Baltimore also boasts a +4.7 first-half point differential, while the Saints clock in at -2.3. Plus, in his 57 career regular-season starts, Jackson is 36-19-2 ATS in the first half. Schatz: I'll take Taysom Hill as the first TD scorer (+700). We know the Saints like to switch it up with Hill near the goal line, and the Ravens rank only 25th in run defense DVOA this season. This prop probably doesn't hit, but +700 is good value on it. Snellings: I'm also going to go with Hill, but as an \"anytime\" touchdown (+155). Hill has scored six times in seven games, with his most recent coming on a reception after his first five were on the ground. He didn't score any touchdowns in Week 8 -- despite a season-high 10 carries and 11 touches -- in large part because Kamara scored three times. It feels like Hill is due. Marks: My anytime TD pick is Likely (+140). With Andrews and Bateman both out, Likely should receive the lion's share of targets. He was 6-for-6 last week with 77 yards and a score. He had a fantastic training camp and, as we know, the Ravens' passing game goes through the tight ends.", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-29.031787872314453, -7.654209136962891]}, {"title": "Bengals' Joe Mixon scores 4 touchdowns vs. Panthers in first half, team tops 300 total yards", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bengals-joe-mixon-scores-4-touchdowns-panthers-first-half-team-tops-300-total-yards", "description": "Joe Mixon led the Cincinnati Bengals into halftime with four touchdowns against the Carolina Panthers as part of a 35-point destruction.", "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for November 5 Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

KEVIN MCCARTHY : They [Democrats] have taught us their policies are wrong and what Republicans are doing are fighting to fix all the crises the Democrats have created.

Paul Pelosi was attacked in his home last month by a man with a hammer and left with a skull fracture. The man, an illegal immigrant from Canada named David DePape, allegedly broke into the Pelosi household in San Francisco through a glass door and was on a \"suicide mission\" to \"kneecap\" the House Speaker, according to court filings.

Chuck Schumer said in 2020 during a pro-choice rally hosted by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The remark was slammed by conservatives across the country, and even spurred a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who called the comment \"dangerous.\" Earlier this year, after the Supreme Court effectively ended the recognition of abortion as a constitutional right, an armed man carrying a gun, knife and pepper spray was arrested near Kavanaugh\u2019s home. The man was charged with attempted murder of a federal judge. Video Sen. Mazie Hirono In September, Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono came under fire for saying Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s bill proposal to ban abortions after 15 weeks was \"literally\" a \"call to arms\" to go up against the pro-life movement. The remark was made on the Senate floor and was hit with condemnation in light of how dozens of pro-life centers were vandalized, set on fire and damaged in other ways over the summer in response to the Supreme Court voting to strike down Roe v.

While attending a protest, Jacobs did not condemn nor condone acts of violence against the pro-life movement, saying people should do what they think is necessary to protest the abortion ruling. \"Frankly, the government trying to tell me what to do with my body feels like an act of violence in and of itself,\" Jacobs said in June. \"I think people should do what they think is the most effective way to stand up to this hateful and shameful decision,\" she said when asked if she condoned the violence. Rep. Maxine Waters After the protests and riots of 2020, California Rep. Maxine Waters called on those gathered in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, in 2021 to \"stay on the street\" and \"get more confrontational\" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was acquitted of killing George Floyd. \"We\u2019ve got to stay in the street and demand justice,\" Waters said. \"We got to stay on the street.

Greg Abbott\u2019s re-election campaign were reportedly assaulted while knocking on doors in a Houston suburb in September, and a canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign was attacked and required hospital attention last month. A handful of GOP offices were also reportedly vandalized this election cycle, including one in Florida that was graffitied with the phrase \"eat s*** fascists\" days after Biden called MAGA Republicans \"semi-fascists.\" Democratic campaign offices have also been targeted, including one in Florida that was also vandalized with the word \"Nazi\" written in graffiti .

Mercedes De La Zerda and Franco Lo Presti head up this entry in Lifetime\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Lifetime event, but does this Christmas romcom need a few alterations or is it ready for the runway? The Gist: Mercedes De La Zerda (The Sinner) plays Rachel Rocca, an up-and-coming fashion designer in New York City whose streetwear is \u201chype.\u201d In order to get some much-needed publicity for her in-development menswear brand, Rachel enters a tuxedo contest / bachelor auction that raises money for foster kids and gives the best tux of the night a spot on the cover of Premier Fashion Magazine . Rachel\u2019s all ready to bring her colorful style to formalwear when she gets paired with Brett Stone (Franco Lo Presti), a social media entrepreneur who only wears black . Can Rachel bring some color into this millionaire\u2019s life, or will she go from having her tuxes on the cover to searching for gigs in the want ads? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: This is pretty standard Lifetime romcom fare, and not even the introduction of fashion or tech into the mix cause Well Suited for Christmas deviate from the formula. Performance Worth Watching: Xavier Sotelo and Stephanie Herrera are fun to watch as Rachel\u2019s visiting parents. Fun fact: they were both in the 2020 Lifetime movie Christmas Unwrapped , which is one Lifetime movie that you should seek out this season . Memorable Dialogue: Oh, honey, when Rachel reads this random stranger for having the audacity to not wear color: \u201cSome men aren\u2019t hindered by archaic male stereotypes.\u201d Of course that stranger ends up being her new client, Brett Stone. Meet cute? More like meet ugly . A Holiday Tradition: There\u2019s the annual NYC Christmas gala and the first Christmas runway contest and bachelor auction. Brett\u2019s company Connection Link \u2014 oh, yes, the Facebook analogue is called Connection Link \u2014 has a ceremony for the annual lighting of the in-office Christmas tree. And Rachel\u2019s mom makes a bunch of tiny angel figurines for her church\u2019s Christmas bazaar back in Milwaukee. Two Turtle Doves: If you want another movie about merry menswear, you can check out UPtv\u2019s Santa\u2019s Got Style (Dec. 11). In it, a department store exec gives her store\u2019s Santa a cool, sexy makeover. Santa\u2019s got a brand new bag, and the bag is Jack Spade . Does the Title Make Any Sense?: The pun works in one direction \u2014 Rachel\u2019s definitely trying to make sure that a man is wearing a suit well \u2014 but Brett Stone\u2019s icy demeanor isn\u2019t particularly well suited for Christmas. He\u2019s no scrooge, but he\u2019s not exactly the type to interject \u201clike a lightbulb!\u201d while everyone\u2019s singing \u201cRudolph.\u201d What about The Christmas Tux or \u2014 oh, oh no \u2014 Merry TuXmas ? That hurts to look at, let alone hear. The title is fine. Dear lord, my apologies for that. Our Take: This is a holiday romcom tailor made for Lifetime, which means that it\u2019s like a Hallmark romcom except it\u2019s not terrified of cities. Finally, a Christmas movie in New York City \u2014 wherein our fashionista-on-the-rise lives in a multi-story condo with a huge kitchen and a front door that opens right off the street. Are we sure this movie isn\u2019t about two millionaires falling in love? Well Suited for Christmas follows the Lifetime holiday movie pattern so closely, it\u2019s as if that pattern was printed and sold by McCall\u2019s. It\u2019s missing any kind of embellishment, a metaphorical sequin or pointless zipper \u2014 literally anything to make it stand out from all the other Lifetime movies on the rack. That\u2019s a shame, because the film features a collision of two very distinct worlds: fashion and tech. Each one is ripe for comedy, or at least conflict. Instead, we get a NYC fashion scene where everyone is nice (there\u2019s nada of Devil Wears Prada here) and a tech company that is sincerely into helping foster children. The conflict really boils down to whether or not Brett Stone \u2014 who comes across as kind of a low-energy, always scowling Adam Neumann type? \u2014 will wear a color, any color, even if it\u2019s just a read flower on his lapel. Well Suited for Christmas does have something deep to say about how our clothing choices tell a story and how we can assign personal meaning and significance to something as nondescript as the color black. It\u2019s a shame that there\u2019s not more style to this movie, because the performances are solid and the premise is rich with potential. Seriously, there\u2019s so much that could have been done with \u2014 and this bears repeating \u2014 a tuxedo contest / bachelor auction that raises money for foster kids .

The 19-year-old Rune, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, lost the first set and came from a break down in the second to level the match. He then had to hold his nerve in the decider, breaking for a 6-5 lead before saving six breaks points to take the biggest title of his career. The victory makes Rune the youngest champion in Paris since Boris Becker in 1986 and sees him enter the top 10 of the world rankings for the first time. Nick Kyrgios settles legal case with Wimbledon fan he accused of being 'drunk out of her mind,' her lawyers say \u201cI want to start by saying huge congrats to Novak also,\u201d he said to Djokovic, who is 16 years his senior, in his post-match interview. \u201cYou\u2019re one of my favourite players, I\u2019ve been watching you since I was a little kid, practicing with you. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to share the court with you now.\u201d Hot on the heels of 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s maiden grand slam title at the US Open in September, Rune now looks set to join the Spaniard as another of the game\u2019s rising stars. Djokovic had said ahead of Sunday\u2019s final how Rune \u201creminds me of myself,\u201d and in the final the Dane duly had to channel the mental toughness and never-say-die attitude that has characterized much of Djokovic\u2019s career. The victory capped off a superb week for Rune, having defeated five top-10 players over the course of the tournament, while also saving match points against Stan Wawrinka in the first round. When he won an epic, 16-minute game to complete the victory against Djokovic, Rune lay on the floor and covered his hands over his face in disbelief. \u201cIf you told me four weeks ago, I would be in the top 10 \u2026 I would be like: \u2018What, sorry?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m here and I\u2019m super proud.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "cnn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-12.441530227661133, -13.264554977416992]}, {"title": "Italy's Pecco Bagnaia takes historic MotoGP title", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/motorsport/pecco-bagnala-motogp-italy-spt-intl/index.html", "description": "Francesco 'Pecco' Bagnaia fired his Ducati to an historic MotoGP title on Sunday, in front of 170,380 fans at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia, Spain.", "content": "Francesco \u2018Pecco\u2019 Bagnaia fired his Ducati to an historic MotoGP title on Sunday, in front of 170,380 fans at the Ricardo Tormo circuit in Valencia, Spain. He becomes the first Italian to win the premier class since the great Valentino Rossi in 2009, the first Ducati rider to take the crown since Casey Stoner in 2007, and the first Italian to clinch the title on an Italian bike since the legendary Giacomo Agostini, five decades ago in 1972. Just a few short months ago, such a victory looked more fantasy than possibility. Pecco Bagnaia: Wild wins, pop videos, and a famous mentor: why Italian is MotoGPs rising star Going into the summer break the Italian trailed Yamaha\u2019s Fabio Quartararo by 91 points, but a series of disastrous showings by the 2021 champion and masterful wins by Bagnaia \u2013 seven in total across the season \u2013 saw the gap evaporate. Quartararo needed to win in Valencia and hope Bagnaia scored fewer than two points. The Yamaha rider launched into the race determined to fulfill his side of the bargain. A breathless first few laps saw he and Bagnaia locked together, exchanging places with close passes. At one point the two bikes clashed, sending one of the Ducati\u2019s aerodynamic wings spinning into the gravel. Bagnaia then settled into the pack behind his rival, who was struggling to follow the leaders. Around him riders skittled out of the race, with Marc Marquez, Jack Miller and Johan Zarco among those sent sprawling. Suzuki\u2019s Alex Rins eventually took the win. The Japanese factory announced a surprise withdrawal from MotoGP racing earlier this year, and as a last waltz this was as flawlessly executed as they could have wished. Rins, with pictures of his Suzuki teammates on his helmet and good luck messages from Suzuki fans adorning his team\u2019s garage, crossed the line ahead of KTM\u2019s Brad Binder and Ducati\u2019s Jorge Martin. Quartararo slumped onto the tank of his Yamaha as he crossed the line in fourth. Bagnaia\u2019s ninth place was more than enough to make him champion. \u201cIt\u2019s the best day of my life,\u201d Bagnaia told MotoGP.com in Parc Ferm\u00e9. \u201cI was struggling a lot. My mission was to be in the top five, but I didn\u2019t know why, after the first three or four laps I started to struggle very much with the front of the bike, it was impossible to control. But then the most important thing is that we won, and we are the world champion and it\u2019s a really great day, I\u2019m very happy.\u201d", "date": "2022-11-06", "source": "cnn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-11.881357192993164, -13.987261772155762]}, {"title": "Rivera unsure if healthy Wentz gets QB job back", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35033980/commanders-coach-torn-taylor-heinicke-improving-carson-wentz?device=featurephone", "description": "Commanders QB Carson Wentz is eligible to come off IR this week, but coach Ron Rivera said he's not sure if Wentz is ready or if he will get the starting job back from Taylor Heinicke.", "content": "The Washington Commanders have a decision to make at quarterback, but coach Ron Rivera still isn't sure when it must be made. Rivera said he's still not sure if Carson Wentz will be activated off injured reserve this week after missing the last four games with a fractured right ring finger. It was originally thought that the injury would sideline him for four weeks. If that's the case, then Wentz could be activated this week. However, even if he is available there's a good chance Washington sticks with his replacement, Taylor Heinicke. Though he lacks Wentz's size or arm, the Commanders have gone 3-1 with Heinicke starting and sprung a big upset on Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Rivera said he still has to meet with trainers to discuss Wentz's condition and then discuss the situation with offensive coordinator Scott Turner and quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese. Then, when Rivera decides on a starter, he would first meet with the players involved and then inform the team. That would not happen until Wednesday morning at the earliest. \"You have to look at the momentum and what the mood of the team is,\" Rivera said. \"There are a lot of factors.\" Washington acquired Wentz, the second overall pick in the 2016 draft, from the Indianapolis Colts in the offseason. The teams swapped second-round draft picks last April, and the Commanders also sent a third-round choice in 2022 and a conditional third in 2023. The latter turns into a second-round pick if Wentz plays 70% of the snaps this season. Wentz, who started the first six games, fractured his right ring finger in a 12-7 win over the Chicago Bears on Oct. 13 and was placed on injured reserve. While the offense remained inconsistent, he did lead a late drive to clinch a win against the Green Bay Packers and also a last-second march to win at Indianapolis in addition to Monday night's upset. Heinicke has posted a 47.2 quarterback rating in his four starts compared to Wentz's 32.4 in six starts. Wentz also had to learn a new offense, having played in a different system his previous six seasons. It led to him holding the ball longer than usual at times behind shaky pass protection. He was sacked 23 times. \"You look at what is best for the team and that's how it has to be,\" Rivera said. \"There's a great saying, 'You treat everyone the same, you treat everyone fair but you treat everyone according to the team. So the decision will be made about the team first and foremost. Whoever the starter is I will commit to them fully. I don't want them looking over their shoulder.\" But Rivera stopped short of saying any decision would be for the remainder of the season. After Monday's win, Heinicke said he's not worried about any decision. \"I said it back in OTAs that we brought Carson in to be a starter. If my number is called, I'll be ready to go in,\" Heinicke said. \"Whatever decision they want to make, let's go. If I'm backing up Carson next week, great. The biggest thing for me is let's just go win. Let's keep winning whether it means playing or not.\" Heinicke does have the support of the locker room. They've gravitated to his underdog story -- the former undrafted quarterback who was sleeping on his sister's couch at this time two years ago before Washington signed him in December 2020. He started a playoff game that season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and played well in a 31-23 loss. \"He's been great for us since he's got here, honestly,\" receiver Terry McLaurin said. \"He plays with no fear, everything's not pretty. He is going to extend plays with his legs and get the tough yards. He is going to get us in the right situations. You just feel confident with a guy back there like that. A lot of people want to measure his height, his arm, all those things. You can't measure what's inside of his chest.\"", "date": "2022-11-15", "source": "espn", "category": "sports", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-24.084121704101562, -13.799577713012695]}, {"title": "Dionne Warwick: \u2018I will be dating Pete Davidson next\u2019", "link": "https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/dionne-warwick-i-will-be-dating-pete-davidson-next/", "description": "The 81-year-old musical icon is into the former \"SNL\" star's infamous \"BDE.\"", "content": "Dionne Warwick is into Pete Davidson\u2019s infamous \u201cBDE.\u201d \u201cI will be dating Pete Davidson next,\u201d the 81-year-old singer tweeted Monday, adding the \u201cTweeting it into existence\u201d status.

Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption Ecuador's Enner Valencia celebrates after scoring his side's second goal during the match between Qatar and Ecuador in Al Khor, Qatar, on Sunday. AL KHOR, Qatar \u2014 Qatar's first ever World Cup match ended in dismay for an overmatched team and with a place in unwanted soccer history. The controversy-laced tournament opened Sunday with Qatar getting outplayed and embarrassed in a 2-0 loss to Ecuador in front of 67,372 fans at Al Bayt Stadium. In 92 years of soccer's biggest event, a host team had never lost its opening game. The first World Cup in the Middle East is a chance for Qatar, a tiny Arab country jutting out into the Persian Gulf, to showcase itself to the wider world. Its soccer team, playing at this level for the first time by virtue of hosting the tournament, couldn't live up to the moment as Ecuador captain Enner Valencia scored both goals in the first half. The match took place after a colorful 30-minute opening ceremony \u2014 fronted by Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman and attended by powerful dignitaries including Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 that promoted inclusivity and mankind living \"under one tent.\" For many, that would jar with this World Cup being hosting by an emirate where homosexual acts are illegal, one that has come under strong criticism for how migrant workers have been treated building stadiums and tournament infrastructure since Qatar won the scandal-shrouded vote in 2010. The yearslong scrutiny was never going to stop just because play on the field finally entered the narrative of a tournament dogged by human rights controversies, yet a win for the host nation would have at least put a favorable light on Qatar, soccer-wise. Instead, Qatar's players, fresh from spending seven months together in a pre-tournament training camp under Spanish coach Felix Sanchez, froze in front of an expectant crowd and a disciplined Ecuador team that might just pose a danger to more high-profile opponents over the next few weeks. Valencia thought he had scored in the third minute when he headed in from close range following an acrobatic cross from Felix Torres. After a video review of about two minutes, Ecuadorian celebrations were cut short when the goal was ruled out for what appeared to be a marginal offside. Ecuador did take the lead, however, in the 16th minute when Valencia was tripped by Saad Alsheeb after rounding the goalkeeper, who was booked for the challenge. Valencia was nonchalant as he trotted up and converted the spot kick into the bottom corner. The 33-year-old striker added his second in the 33rd by heading in a right-wing cross from Angelo Preciado. With Qatar's passes often going astray and its defensive raggedness repeatedly exposed, Ecuador had no problem holding onto its lead as Sanchez stood helpless in his technical area and the home fans fell quiet. There were lots of empty seats for a second half that was almost a damage-limitation exercise for Qatar on one of the biggest nights in the nation's history. Camels and Arabian horses lined the entrance to the stadium, a Bedouin tent-inspired venue located in the rather isolated surrounds of the rural town of Al Khor, north of Doha. And the atmospheric, seven-act opening ceremony lived up to its billing, the highlight being when Freeman extended one yellow-gloved hand to a FIFA World Cup ambassador suffering from a rare spinal disorder in an image representing inclusion in a country facing international criticism over its human-rights record. Looking on from the luxury seats were FIFA president Gianni Infantino alongside leaders from the Middle East and Africa. Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, drew a thunderous applause in a short speech delivered in Arabic from the suite, with Infantino and the monarch's father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, on either side of him. \"I welcome you and good luck to all,\" the emir said in his only words spoken in English. After this display, Qatar will need more than just luck to avoid joining South Africa as being the only host nation to fail to get out of the group stage at the World Cup. The first half was winding down when a chant came from a large section of vocal, yellow-clad Ecuador fans: \"We want beer.\" It was a humorous intervention two days after Qatar decided to ban beer sales at the stadiums during the World Cup. It was a late change by the conservative Islamic nation where access to alcohol is strictly limited. Only alcohol-free Bud Zero was sold at the game. In what will go down as one of the worst displays by a host nation to open a tournament, Qatar had five shots in the match and none of them were on target. The team had only two touches inside the opposition penalty area. Qatar will look to bounce back against Senegal in Group A on Friday, on the same day Ecuador takes on the Netherlands.", "date": "2022-11-20", "source": "npr", "category": "top", "authors": null, "vectors": null, "coordinates": [-14.647135734558105, -14.081984519958496]}]
